# Overview

> This section contains how-to guides for specific tasks across Pulp Project:

Here you'll find:

- **Content Types**: content-specific tasks.
- **General**: common tasks not tied to a specific Content Plugin 

## How to use these guides

It is expected that you have a basic **background**, that is, that you are familiar with fundamental practices and concepts presented in [Getting Started](#).
Each task may ask for some specific pre-requisites, so make sure you are confortable with them before starting.

If something is not going on as expected, feel free **get help** throught the [Pulp Community](#).
Also, we're always trying to improve, so if you think you can **contribute** with some guides, checkout the [Contributing to Docs](#) section.


## Conventions

- There are several ways of interacting with a pulp instance.
Through this guide we'll try to maintain both REST API and CLI methods.
