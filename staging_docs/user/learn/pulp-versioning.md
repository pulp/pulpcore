# Pulp Versioning

Pulp uses a version scheme `x.y.z`, which is based on [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). Briefly, `x.y.z` releases may only contain bugfixes (no features),
`x.y` releases may only contain backwards compatible changes (new features, bugfixes), and `x`
releases may break backwards compatibility.

## Plugin API

The plugin API is provided by the pulpcore package and is not versioned independently. `x.y.z`
releases of pulpcore should provide backwards compatible releases of the Plugin API but `x.y`
releases might bring backwards incompatible changes of the plugin API.

We expect the plugin API to eventually be Semantically Versioned so that only `x` releases of
pulpcore will bring backwards incompatible changes to the plugin API. Until then, we recommend
plugins pin to `x.y` releases of pulpcore.
