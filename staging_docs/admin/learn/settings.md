# Settings

There are only two required settings, although specific plugins may have additional required
settings.

- {ref}`SECRET_KEY <secret-key-setting>`
- {ref}`CONTENT_ORIGIN <content-origin-setting>`

!!! note
For more information on how to specify settings see the
{ref}`Applying Settings docs <applying-settings>`.


Pulp uses three types of settings:

- {ref}`Django settings <django-settings>` Pulp is configuring
- {ref}`Redis settings <redis-settings>` Pulp is using
- {ref}`Pulp defined settings <pulp-settings>`

(django-settings)=

## Django Settings

Below is a list of the most common Django settings Pulp users typically use. Pulp is a Django
project, so any [Django setting](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/) can be set.

(secret-key-setting)=

### SECRET_KEY

> In order to get a pulp server up and running a [Django SECRET_KEY](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/#secret-key) *must* be
> provided.
>
> The following code snippet can be used to generate a random SECRET_KEY.

```{code-block} python
:linenos: true

import random

chars = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*(-_=+)'
print(''.join(random.choice(chars) for i in range(50)))
```

### DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY

> The file location of a symmetric fernet key that Pulp uses to encrypt sensitive fields in the
> database. Default location is `/etc/pulp/certs/database_fields.symmetric.key`.
>
> The key is automatically generated by default with the pulp-oci-images. The key can be generated
> independently but it must be a url-safe base64-encoded string of 32 random bytes.
>
> To generate a key with openssl:
>
> ```
> openssl rand -base64 32 > /etc/pulp/certs/database_fields.symmetric.key
> ```
>
> This file can contain multiple such keys (one per line). The key in the first line will be used
> for encryption but all others will still be attempted to decrypt old tokens. This can help you to
> rotate this key in the following way:
>
> 1. Shut down all Pulp services (api, content and worker processes).
> 2. Add a new key at the top of the key file.
> 3. Call `pulpcore-manager rotate-db-key`.
> 4. Remove the old key (on the second line) from the key file.
> 5. Start the Pulp services again.
>
> For a zero downtime key rotation you can follow the slightly more complex recipe:
> 1\. Add a new key at the bottom of the key file.
> 2\. Restart the Pulp services in the usual phased manner.
> 3\. Swap the keys in the key file.
> 4\. Restart the Pulp services again.
> 5\. Call `pulpcore-manager rotate-db-key`.
> 6\. Remove the old key (on the second line) from the key file.
> 7\. Restart the Pulp services for the last time.

### DATABASES

> By default Pulp uses PostgreSQL on localhost. PostgreSQL is the only supported database. For
> instructions on how to configure the database, refer to {ref}`database installation <database-install>`.

### DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE

> By default, Pulp uses the local filesystem to store files. The default option which
> uses the local filesystem is `pulpcore.app.models.storage.FileSystem`.
>
> For more information about different Pulp storage options, see the
> {ref}`storage documentation <storage>`.

### REDIRECT_TO_OBJECT_STORAGE

> When set to `True` access to artifacts is redirected to the corresponding Cloud storage
> configured in `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` using pre-authenticated URLs. When set to `False`
> artifacts are always served by the content app instead.
>
> Defaults to `True`; ignored for local file storage.

### MEDIA_ROOT

> The location where Pulp will store files. By default this is `/var/lib/pulp/media`.
>
> This only affects storage location when `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` is set to
> `pulpcore.app.models.storage.FileSystem`. See the {ref}`storage documentation <storage>` for
> more info.
>
> It should have permissions of:
>
> - mode: 750
> - owner: pulp (the account that pulp runs under)
> - group: pulp (the group of the account that pulp runs under)
> - SELinux context: system_u:object_r:pulpcore_var_lib_t:s0

### LOGGING

> By default Pulp logs at an INFO level to syslog. For all possible configurations please
> refer to [Django documenation on logging](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/logging/#configuring-logging)
>
> Enabling DEBUG logging is a common troubleshooting step. See the {ref}`enabling-debug-logging`
> documentation for details on how to do that.

### AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS

> By default, Pulp has two types of authentication enabled, and they fall back for each other:
>
> 1. Basic Auth which is checked against an internal users database
> 2. Webserver authentication that relies on the webserver to perform the authentication.
>
> To change the authentication types Pulp will use, modify the `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`
> settings. See the [Django authentication documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/auth/customizing/#authentication-backends) for more information.

(redis-settings)=

## Redis Settings

!!! warning
To enable usage of Redis the [CACHE_ENABLED] option must be set to `True`.


The following Redis settings can be set in your Pulp config:

> - REDIS_URL
> - REDIS_HOST
> - REDIS_PORT
> - REDIS_DB
> - REDIS_PASSWORD

Below are some common settings used for Redis configuration.

### REDIS_HOST

> The hostname for Redis.

### REDIS_PORT

> The port for Redis.

### REDIS_PASSWORD

> The password for Redis.

(pulp-settings)=

## Pulp Settings

Pulp defines the following settings itself:

(api-root)=

### API_ROOT

> A string containing the path prefix for the Pulp API. This is used by the REST API when forming
> URLs to refer clients to other parts of the REST API and by the `pulpcore-api` application to
> match incoming URLs. Pulp appends the string `api/v3/` to this setting.
>
> Defaults to `/pulp/`. After the application appends `api/v3/` it makes the V3 API by default
> serve from `/pulp/api/v3/`.

### WORKING_DIRECTORY

> The directory used by workers to stage files temporarily. This defaults to
> `/var/lib/pulp/tmp/`.
>
> It should have permissions of:
>
> - mode: 750
> - owner: pulp (the account that pulp runs under)
> - group: pulp (the group of the account that pulp runs under)
> - SELinux context: system_u:object_r:pulpcore_var_lib_t:s0

!!! note
It is recommended that `WORKING_DIRECTORY` and `MEDIA_ROOT` exist on the same storage
volume for performance reasons. Files are commonly staged in the `WORKING_DIRECTORY` and
validated before being moved to their permanent home in `MEDIA_ROOT`.


### CHUNKED_UPLOAD_DIR

> A relative path inside the DEPLOY_ROOT directory used exclusively for uploaded chunks. The
> uploaded chunks are stored in the default storage specified by `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE`. This
> option allows users to customize the actual place where chunked uploads should be stored within
> the declared storage. The default, `upload`, is sufficient for most use cases. A change to
> this setting only applies to uploads created after the change.

(content-origin-setting)=

### CONTENT_ORIGIN

> A required string containing the protocol, fqdn, and port where the content app is reachable by
> users. This is used by `pulpcore` and various plugins when referring users to the content app.
> For example if the API should refer users to content at using http to pulp.example.com on port
> 24816, (the content default port), you would set: `https://pulp.example.com:24816`.

### HIDE_GUARDED_DISTRIBUTIONS

> If activated, the distributions that are protected by a content guard will not be shown on the
> directory listing in the content app. Defaults to `False`.

(content-path-prefix)=

### CONTENT_PATH_PREFIX

> A string containing the path prefix for the content app. This is used by the REST API when
> forming URLs to refer clients to the content serving app, and by the content serving application
> to match incoming URLs.
>
> Defaults to `/pulp/content/`.

(content-app-ttl)=

### CONTENT_APP_TTL

> The number of seconds before a content app should be considered lost.
>
> Defaults to `30` seconds.

(pulp-cache)=

### CACHE_ENABLED

> Store cached responses from the content app into Redis. This setting improves the performance
> of the content app under heavy load for similar requests. Defaults to `False`.
>
> !!! note
> The entire response is not stored in the cache. Only the location of the file needed to
> recreate the response is stored. This reduces database queries and allows for many
> responses to be stored inside the cache.
> 

### CACHE_SETTINGS

> Dictionary with tunable settings for the cache:
>
> - `EXPIRES_TTL` - Number of seconds entries should stay in the cache before expiring.
>
> Defaults to `600` seconds.
>
> !!! note
> Set to `None` to have entries not expire.
> Content app responses are always invalidated when the backing distribution is updated.
> 

### DOMAIN_ENABLED

> !!! note
> This feature is provided as a tech-preview
> 
>
> Enable the {ref}`Domains feature to enable multi-tenancy capabilities <domains>`. All installed
> plugins must be Domain compatible for Pulp to start. Defaults to `False`.

(worker-ttl)=

### WORKER_TTL

> The number of seconds before a worker should be considered lost.
>
> Defaults to `30` seconds.

(remote-user-environ-name)=

### REMOTE_USER_ENVIRON_NAME

> The name of the WSGI environment variable to read for {ref}`webserver authentication
> <webserver-authentication>`.
>
> !!! warning
> Configuring this has serious security implications. See the [Django warning at the end of this
> section in their docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/howto/auth-remote-user/#configuration) for more details.
> 
>
> Defaults to `'REMOTE_USER'`.

(allowed-import-paths)=

### ALLOWED_IMPORT_PATHS

> One or more real filesystem paths that Remotes with filesystem paths can import from. For example
> to allow a remote url of `file:///mnt/foo/bar/another/folder/` you could specify:
>
> ```
> ALLOWED_IMPORT_PATHS = ['/mnt/foo/bar']  # only a subpath is needed
> ```
>
> Defaults to `[]`, meaning `file:///` urls are not allowed in any Remote.

(allowed-export-paths)=

### ALLOWED_EXPORT_PATHS

> One or more real filesystem paths that Exporters can export to. For example to allow a path of
> `/mnt/foo/bar/another/folder/` you could specify:
>
> ```
> ALLOWED_EXPORT_PATHS = ['/mnt/foo/bar']  # only a subpath is needed
> ```
>
> Defaults to `[]` which means no path is allowed.

(allowed-content-checksums)=

### ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS

> !!! warning
> Enforcement of this setting in `pulpcore` and various plugins is not fully in place. It is
> possible that checksums not in this list may still be used in various places. This banner will
> be removed when it is believed all `pulpcore` and plugin code fully enforces this setting.
> 
>
> The list of content-checksums this pulp-instance is **allowed to use**. By default the following
> are used:
>
> ```
> ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS = ["sha224", "sha256", "sha384", "sha512"]
> ```
>
> The entire set of supported checksums are: `md5`, `sha1`, `sha224`, `sha256`,
> `sha384`, and `sha512`.
>
> !!! warning
> Due to its use as the primary content-identifier, "sha256" **IS REQUIRED**. Pulp will
> fail to start if `"sha256"` is not found in this set.
> 
>
> Pulp can prohibit or allow checksums by setting the ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS setting.
> Changing this setting requires a few steps.
>
> First, before you change the setting, see how your Pulp instance will be impacted by this change by running:
>
> `pulpcore-manager handle-artifact-checksums --report --checksums sha256,512`
>
> Adjust `--checksums` as comma separated list of checksums types to match your needs.
>
> !!! note
> If you already changed `ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS` in pulp settings you can leave out `--checksums`,
> and the checksums will be parsed from Pulp settings.
> 
>
> Before switching, any on-demand repos containing forbidden checksum digests needs to be synced with
> `policy=immediate` to populate missing allowed checksums. This can heavily impact your disk space.
> Alternatively, users can remove these offending repo versions followed by orphan cleanup.
>
> If you have artifacts that do not conform to your ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS setting, they need to be re-hashed.
> You can update them using:
>
> `pulpcore-manager handle-artifact-checksums`
>
> !!! warning
> If Pulp fails to start because forbidden checkums have been identified or required ones are
> missing, run `pulpcore-manager handle-artifact-checksums` command.
> 

(django-guid)=

### DJANGO_GUID

> Pulp uses `django-guid` to append correlation IDs to logging messages. Correlation IDs are
> autogenerated by default but can also be sent as a header with each request. They are also
> returned as a header in the response and are recorded in the `logging_cid` field of tasks.
>
> For more information on how to configure the `DJANGO_GUID` setting, see the [django-guid
> settings documentation](https://django-guid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html).

(orphan-protection-time)=

### ORPHAN_PROTECTION_TIME

> The time specified in minutes for how long Pulp will hold orphan Content and Artifacts before
> they become candidates for deletion by an orphan cleanup task. This should ideally be longer
> than your longest running task otherwise any content created during that task could be cleaned
> up before the task finishes. Default is 1440 minutes (24 hours).

(upload-protection-time)=

(tmpfile-protection-time)=

### UPLOAD_PROTECTION_TIME and TMPFILE_PROTECTION_TIME

> Pulp uses `uploads` and `pulp temporary files` to pass data from the api to worker tasks.
> These options allow to specify a timeinterval in minutes used for cleaning up stale entries. If
> set to 0, automatic cleanup is disabled, which is the default.

(task-diagnostics)=

### TASK_DIAGNOSTICS

> If `True`, each task will record various diagnostics (listed below) to files in the dir
> `/var/tmp/pulp/<task_UUID>/`. This is `False` by default.
>
> > - memory - the task's max resident set size in MB.

(analytics-setting)=

### ANALYTICS

> If `True`, Pulp will anonymously post analytics information to
> [https://analytics.pulpproject.org/](https://analytics.pulpproject.org/) and aids in project decision making. See the
> {ref}`analytics docs <analytics>` for more info on exactly what is posted along with an example.
>
> Defaults to `True`.
