# Applying Settings

Pulp uses [dynaconf](https://www.dynaconf.com/) for its settings which allows you
to configure Pulp settings using various ways:

- {ref}`Environment Variables <env-var-settings>` - Enabled by default.
- {ref}`Configuration File <config-file-settings>` - Disabled by default, but easy to enable.

(env-var-settings)=

## Environment Variables

Configuration by specifying environment variables is enabled by default. Any
{ref}`Setting <settings>` can be configured using Dynaconf by prepending `PULP_` to the setting
name. For example {ref}`SECRET_KEY <secret-key-setting>` can be specified as the `PULP_SECRET_KEY`
environment variable. For example, in a shell you can use `export` to set this:

```
export PULP_SECRET_KEY="This should be a 50 chars or longer unique secret!"
```

(config-file-settings)=

## Configuration File

By default, Pulp does not read settings from a configuration file. Enable this by specifying the
`PULP_SETTINGS` environment variable with the path to your configuration file. For example:

```
export PULP_SETTINGS=/etc/pulp/settings.py
```

Then you can specify settings with Python variable assignment in the `/etc/pulp/settings.py`. For
example, you can specify {ref}`SECRET_KEY <secret-key-setting>` with:

```
$ cat /etc/pulp/settings.py
SECRET_KEY="This should be a 50 chars or longer unique secret!"
```

In this example the settings file ends in ".py" so it needs to be valid Python, but it could use any
[dynaconf supported format](https://www.dynaconf.com/#supported-formats).

!!! note
The configuration file and directories containing the configuration file must be readable by the
user Pulp runs as. If using SELinux, assign the `system_u:object_r:pulpcore_etc_t:s0` label.
