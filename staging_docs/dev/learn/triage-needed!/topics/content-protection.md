# Content Protection

By default, the Content app will serve all content, but some deployments want to only serve content
to some users and not others. For example pulp_rpm only wants to give rpms to users who have valid
certificates declaring their paid access to content. To allow total customization of how content is
protected, A plugin writer can define a `ContentGuard`.

## Defining a ContentGuard

The `ContentGuard` is a Master/Detail object provided at
`from pulpcore.plugin.models import ContentGuard`, which provides [these base fields](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/blob/master/pulpcore/app/models/publication.py#L192-L202).

In your plugin code, subclass `ContentGuard` and optionally add additional fields as necessary to
perform the authentication and authorization. Then overwrite the `permit` method so that it
returns `None` if access is granted and throws a `PermissionError` on denial. As with all
Master/Detail objects a `TYPE` class attribute is needed which is then used in the URL. For
`ContentGuard` detail objects the URL structure is:

```
``/pulp/api/v3/contentguards/<plugin_name>/<TYPE>/``
```

!!! note
The [pulp-certguard](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_certguard/) plugin ships various
`ContentGuard` types for users and plugin writers to use together. Plugins can ship their own
content guards too, but look at the existing ones first.


## Simple Example

Here's a trivial example where the client needs to send a header named SECRET_STRING and if its
value matches a recorded value for that ContentGuard instance, give the content to the user. The
secret both authenticates the user and authorizes them for this Content.

```python
from django.db import models
from pulpcore.plugin.models import ContentGuard

class SecretStringContentGuard(ContentGuard):

    TYPE = 'secret_string'

    secret_string = models.FileField(max_length=255)

    def permit(self, request):
        """

        Authorize the specified web request.

        Args:
            request (aiohttp.web.Request): A request for a published file.

        Raises:
            PermissionError: When the request cannot be authorized.
        """
        ca = self.ca_certificate.read()
        validator = Validator(ca.decode('utf8'))
        validator(request)

    class Meta:
        default_related_name = "%(app_label)s_%(model_name)s"
```

### End-User use of ContentGuard

Users create an instance of a `SecretStringContentGuard` and give it a secret string with
`httpie`:

```
http POST http://localhost:24817/pulp/api/v3/contentguards/<plugin_name>/secret_string/ \
              secret_string='2xlSFgJwOhbLrtIlmYszqHQy7ivzdQo9'
```

Then the user can protect one or more Distributions by specifying `content_guard`. See the
[ContentGuard creation API](https://docs.pulpproject.org/restapi.html#operation/distributions_file_file_create) for more information.



### Plugin Writer use of ContentGuard

Plugin writers can also programatically create detail `ContentGuard` instances and have the
plugin's detail Distribution they define force its use. This allows plugin writers to offer
content protection features to users with fewer user required steps.
