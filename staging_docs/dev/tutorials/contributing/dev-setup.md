# Developer Setup

To ease developer setup, we have the [oci-env](https://github.com/pulp/oci_env) which is our
developer environment based off the [Pulp OCI Images](https://github.com/pulp/pulp-oci-images).
It is a CLI tool that uses `docker/podman-compose` to quickly setup a Pulp instance with your
specified configuration.



## Get the Source

It is assumed that any Pulp project repositories are cloned into one directory. You must clone the
`oci-env` into the same directory as all of your other Pulp project repositories.:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/pulp/oci_env.git
```

You will need `pulp/pulpcore` at a minimum:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore.git
```

Additionally, you will need at least one plugin.:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/pulp/pulp_file.git
```

The current base branch on this repository is the main branch.

!!! warning
It is important to ensure that your repositories are all checked out to compatible versions.
Check the `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` files of each repository to see what version
it provides and which versions it requires, respectively.


## Installation

Follow the steps at [Getting Started](https://github.com/pulp/oci_env/#getting-started) to setup
your Pulp instance after cloning the Pulp repositories.
