    large repositories in parallel.
    [#2307](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2307)

-   Made the API root endpoint accessible for anonymous users once again.
    [#2340](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2340)

-   Removed il8n from the logs written so they will always show up in English for speedy resolution of
    error messages. All user facing strings are still expected to be il8n.
    [#2477](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2477)

-   Replaced "//" with "/" in base_url when CONTENT_PATH_PREFIX is "" or "/".
    [#2553](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2553)

-   Fixed does_batch method in sync pipeline to allow waiting on content that is already resolved.
    [#2557](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2557)

-   Restore multiple-retry logic for PulpImport.
    [#2854](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2854)

#### Improved Documentation

-   Cleared out some of the paragraphs from the "Pull Request Walkthrough" section.
    [#1852](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/1852)
-   Added a troubleshooting section that includes information on how to enable DEBUG logging.
    [#1944](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/1944)
-   Removed some out of date references to Redmine (the previous issue tracker). We use Github Issues
    now.
    [#2642](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2642)
-   Added a note about explicitly setting `content_object` to null when assigning model-level
    permissions.

-   Update installation instructions about "User and database configuration" for the Database setup to point to a matching Django documentation.
    [#2877](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2877)

#### Removals

-   Removed the group permission endpoints `api/v3/groups/:id/model_permissions/` and
    `api/v3/groups/:id/object_permissions/`. Permissions should be managed via roles exclusively.
    [#2050](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2050)
-   Removed django-guardian from the stack. The `guardian.backends.ObjectPermissionBackend` should
    not be used anymore.
    [#2051](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2051)
-   Deprecated creation hook interface was removed. Creation hook need to be registered with the view
    set by the plugin writer before being used. Creation hooks can no longer be added with the
    deprecated name `permission_assignments`.
    [#2559](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2559)

#### Misc

-   [#2070](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2070), [#2244](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2244), [#2605](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2605), [#2643](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2643)

### Plugin API

#### Features

-   Plugins are required to provide the `python_package_name` as a string attribute on their subclass
    of `PulpPluginAppConfig`.
    [#1982](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/1982)

-   Exposed the method `raise_for_unknown_content_units` which raises `ValidationError` for content
    units that were not found in the database.
    [#2052](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2052)

-   Plugins now have to enable default queryset scoping by setting the `queryset_scoping` field on the
    AccessPolicy to `{"function": "scope_queryset"}`.

    Default queryset scoping behavior can be changed by supplying a new `scope_queryset` method.

    Extra queryset scoping functions can be declared on plugin ViewSets and used by setting the
    AccessPolicy's `queryset_scoping` field.
    [#2114](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2114)

-   DeclarativeArtifact now accepts a `urls` option which permits multiple URLs
    to be provided for a single artifact. If multiple URLs are provided, the download
    stage will try each of them in turn upon encountering failures.
    [#2175](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2175)

-   Exposed the function `pulpcore.plugin.util.verify_signature` for verifying signatures created
    by signing services.
    [#2476](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2476)

-   Added `pulpcore.plugin.content.ArtifactResponse` to plugin API. Use this response to stream an
    artifact from the object storage if redirecting is impossible.
    [#2537](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2537)

-   Queryset scoping is now performed when the ViewSet's AccessPolicy field `scope_queryset` is set to
    a function on the ViewSet.

    `NamedModelViewSet` now has default scoping method `scope_queryset` that will scope the request
    off of `queryset_filtering_required_permission` if present. If ViewSet is a master ViewSet then
    scoping will be performed by calling each child's scoping method if present.
    [#2723](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2723)

-   Content ViewSets default `scope_queryset` method will scope based on repositories the user can see.
    [#2724](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2724)

-   Added the ability to specify an upload for the single shot upload serializer. This allows to
    upload files in chunks and attach them with content in repositories without creating orphans.
    [#2786](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2786)

-   Added new access condition `has_required_repo_perms_on_upload` for RBAC plugins to use to require
    users to specify a repository when uploading content. If not used when uploading content, non-admin
    users will not be able to see their uploaded content if queryset scoping is enabled.
    [#2796](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2796)

#### Bugfixes

-   Reworked the ordering framework to use django-filters.

    Plugins should not declare filter-backends on viewsets.
    [#2703](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2703)

#### Improved Documentation

-   Updated plugin writers RBAC guide to explain more roles and less permissions. Removed mentions of
    django-guardian.
    [#2463](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2463)
-   Added docs on the expectation that all user-facing strings are i8ln wrapped with gettext, but log
    messages are not.
    [#2477](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2477)

#### Removals

-   The `pulpcore.plugin.exceptions.MissingResource` object has been removed. Instead let 404
    errors propagate upwards for DRF to handle, or use the DRF exception `NotFound`.
    [#1812](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/1812)
-   Removed django-guardian from the stack. This includes the removal of `AutoDeleteObjPermsMixin`
    from the plugin api.
    [#2051](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2051)
-   Removed the `custom_file_object` argument to `pulpcore.plugin.download.BaseDownloader`. Now all
    downloaded data will be written to a random file in the current working directory. Further
    customization of where downloaded data can be written to can be done through subclassing.
    [#2137](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2137)
-   Constructor signature of DigestValidationError and SizeValidationError has changed - the
    "actual" and "expected" values are now required and "url" which was previously a positional
    argument is now a keyword argument.
    [#2244](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2244)
-   The pulpcore.plugin.constants.API_ROOT has been removed. Use the `V3_API_ROOT` and
    `V3_API_ROOT_NO_FRONT_SLASH` settings instead.
    [#2556](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2556)
-   Plugins using the `SingleArtifactContentUploadSerializer` must place a super call when
    overwriting `deferred_validate`. They can only assume the existance of the `Artifact` in the
    database, after this call.
    [#2786](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2786)

-   Improve content app performance on head requests
    [#2924](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2924)

#### Improved Documentation

## 3.19.0 (2022-04-12) {: #3.19.0 }

### REST API

#### Features

-   Content app now logs where it gets on-demand and streamed content from.
    [#2059](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2059)
-   Reclaim disk space can now accept ["*"] for `repo_hrefs` to specify all repositories for reclaim.
    [#2065](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2065)
-   Added a filter to allow searching for user roles by their description.
    [#2276](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2276)
-   Add swagger view and make OpenAPI human readable
    [#2291](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2291)
-   Adds a `TASK_DIAGNOSTICS` setting which will enable each task to write out diagnostic information
    such as memory usage of the task to a data file in `/var/tmp/pulp/<task_UUID>/`. This is disabled
    by default.
    [#2329](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2329)
-   Added a `/pulp/api/v3/distributions/` endpoint to list all distributions.
    [#2379](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2379)

#### Bugfixes

-   Added reason for 404 error when accessing distributions without a publication.
    [#1910](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/1910)

-   Fixed validation order of required settings to occur before plugin settings are loaded.
    [#1968](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/1968)

-   Fix delete repository version causing "duplicate key value violates unique constraint" error.
    [#2047](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2047)

-   Fixed two instances of Pulp not writing to the task worker's temporary directory.
    [#2061](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2061)

-   Reduced memory usage during tasks like sync by holding fewer objects in-memory unnecessarily.
    [#2069](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2069)

-   Fixed migration 0064_add_new_style_task_columns to purge extraneous ReservedResource and
    TaskReservedResource entries, which could block sync and publish tasks post-upgrade.

    Also taught the migration to bulk-update the Task changes. In large installations, this
    should have a positive impact on the time it takes to apply the migration.
    [#2101](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2101)

-   Taught task-purge to process tasks in batches of 1000. This prevents large purges from using
    large amounts of memory as a result of reading all the affected Tasks into memory at once.
    [#2215](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2215)

-   This fix prevents the lost track of a content removed version when deleting a repository version that deletes a content that is added back in the subsequent version, but deleted again in a later version.
    [#2267](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2267)

-   Added transactions around repository version operations to prevent data loss.
    [#2268](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2268)

    [#2269](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2269)

-   Fix a mistake in a previous migration which may have caused improperly encrypted remote fields.
    [#2327](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2327)

-   Fixed improper fields being listed in `RepositoryVersion` repair API.
    [#2330](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2330)

-   Fixes duplicate key error `Key (content_artifact_id, remote_id)` when creating `RemoteArtifacts`
    during syncs in pulp_container and possibly other plugins.
    [#2381](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2381)

-   Declared proper dependency on user model in migration 0040.
    [#2403](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2403)

-   Fixed a rare deadlock when sync'ing overlapping content in high-concurrency envs.
    [#2420](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2420)

-   Fixed a (rare) deadlock around bulk_update() during syncs with overlapping content.
    [#2430](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2430)

-   Fixed a bug where notifications to workers may go unnoticed. This may lead to idle workers while
    there are tasks waiting.
    [#2506](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2506)

#### Improved Documentation

-   Updates and revises docs on webserver based authentication.
    [#2260](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2260)
-   Adds docs on recording and building graphs from the memory data saved by the `TASK_DIAGNOSTICS`
    setting.
    [#2329](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2329)

#### Removals

-   Removed the Django UI Admin site. It was added to provide RBAC permissions management before there
    were APIs that could provide that. It was tech preview and now there are APIs for user and group
    management, along with role and permission assignment. It is being removed because the direct DB
    access it provides has caused some issues for users, especially since its not integrated with the
    validation provided by Django Rest Framework, which Pulp uses.
    [#2374](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2374)

### Plugin API

#### Features

-   Exposed the `PulpRemoteUserAuthentication` class to plugin writers. This will allow the use of
    remote authentication methods when building protected endpoints.
    [#2262](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2262)
-   Added new global access conditions `has_publication_param_model_or_obj_perms` and
    `has_repo_or_repo_ver_param_model_or_obj_perms` for RBAC checks.
    [#2364](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2364)
-   Changed the `reusable_conditions` module configuration for access policies to being a list to
    enable plugins to add custom modules to it.
    [#2495](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2495)

#### Bugfixes

-   Adjusted the default size of the queues between pipelines to be 1 instead of 1000. The batchers in
    the stage will still accumulate up to 500 (by default) items so batching is still in-effect there
    where it matters.

    [#1945](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/1945)

-   Implemented the Redis caching machinery that can be used within the synchronous context.
    [#2003](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2003)

-   Add a "current_task" field to workers so that you can easily see which workers are currently active.
    [#2034](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2034)

-   Allowed Pulp to install without Redis.
    [#2057](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2057)

-   Added `has_repository_obj_perms` and `has_repository_model_or_obj_perms` as access conditions
    that can be used by viewsets nested beneath repository viewsets.
    [#2076](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2076)

-   Queryset scoping can now be disabled by changing the `DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES`.
    [#2115](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2115)

-   Specifying a different value for `DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES` will now automatically disable the
    permission assignment provided by the `creation_hooks` portion of an `AccessPolicyFromDB`.
    [#2116](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2116)

-   The Pulp API can now be rerooted using the new `API_ROOT` setting. By default it is set to
    `/pulp/`. Pulp appends the string `api/v3/` onto the value of `API_ROOT`.
    [#2148](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2148)

-   Added a redirecting content guard that can be employed by plugins to forward from a REST call to
    the content app.
    [#2151](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2151)

-   Added a new analyze-publication management command to facilitate debugging.
    [#2200](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2200)

-   Added a read-only task schedule view for configured tasks schedules.

    NOTE: This feature is in tech-preview and may change in backwards incompatible ways in the future.

    [#2085](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2085)

-   Fixed file descriptior leak during upload.
    [#2087](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2087)

-   Fixed an api schema bug where both `permission_assignment` and `creation_hooks` were required
    by the `AccessPolicy` serializer.
    [#2089](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2089)

-   Fixed migration 0081 to be compatible with custom User models.
    [#2090](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2090)

    [#2147](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2147)

-   Fixed potential deadlock-window in touch() path.
    [#2157](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2157)

-   Fixed reporting tasks being canceled before being picked up by a worker as canceled instead of
    failed.
    [#2183](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2183)

-   Return a concise message exception on 500 in case file is missing on the FS.
    [#2187](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2187)

-   Fixed import/export of repositories with sub-content.

    An example would be the sub-repositories in pulp_rpm
    DistributionTrees.

-   touch() now uses standard Django instead of raw-sql to update.
    [#2229](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2229)

#### Misc

-   [#2086](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2086), [#2094](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2094), [#2173](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2173), [#2202](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2202)

### Plugin API

#### Features

-   The `AutoAddObjPermsMixin` now calls a `handle_creation_hooks` interface on the configured DRF
    permission class, e.g. the default `AccessPolicyFromDB`.
    [#2116](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2116)
-   Added a redirecting content guard that can be employed by plugins to generate preauthenticated URLs
    that forward from a REST call to the content app. Added the `GetOrCreateSerializerMixin` to
    `get_or_create` objects still validating them through the serializer.
    [#2151](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2151)
-   Exposed synchronous and asynchronous caching machinery. The classes `AsyncContentCache` and
    `SyncContentCache` can be now managed by plugin writers.
    [#8806](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/8806)

#### Bugfixes

-   Started using a plugin provided serializer in has_remote_param_obj_perms and
    has_remote_param_model_or_obj_perms to solve the Unexpected field error during sync by
    a non-admin user.
    [#2088](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2088)
-   Exposed adjust_roles in the plugin api.
    [#2092](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2092)
-   Expose Roles model in plugin api.
    [#2185](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2185)

    [#2123](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2123)

#### Deprecations

-   The `API_ROOT` constant has been deprecated and turned into a setting. Its removal is scheduled
    for 3.20. Please use the setting with the same name instead.
    [#2148](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2148)
-   The `ACCESS_POLICY_VIEWSET_NAME` attribute is no longer expected to be present on models. The
    RBAC machinery no longer uses this, and if present a deprecation warning will be emitted.
    [#2209](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2209)

## 3.17.8 (2022-05-10) {: #3.17.8 }

### REST API

#### Bugfixes

-   Taught PulpImport to stream imports rather than reading files into memory in one chunk.

    This largely alleviates the memory-pressure that results from importing multiple
    large repositories in parallel.
    [#2307](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2307)

-   Fixed does_batch method in sync pipeline to allow waiting on content that is already resolved.
    [#2557](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2557)

-   Ensure downloader resets file on retry.
    [#2576](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2576)

-   Taught PulpImport to retry more than once in the event of creation-collisions.

    This fixes a rare import-failure during high-concurrency, high-content-overlap imports.
    [#2589](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2589)

-   Improved the error message when HTTP proxies reject requests from Pulp.
    [#2654](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2654)

### Plugin API

No significant changes.

## 3.17.7 (2022-04-12) {: #3.17.7 }

### REST API

#### Bugfixes

-   Fixed two instances of Pulp not writing to the task worker's temporary directory.
    [#2061](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2061)
-   Taught task-purge to process tasks in batches of 1000. This prevents large purges from using
    large amounts of memory as a result of reading all the affected Tasks into memory at once.
    [#2215](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2215)
-   Loosened the version-restrictions on PulpImport to only require X.Y matching.
    [#2269](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2269)
-   Fixed a (rare) deadlock around bulk_update() during syncs with overlapping content.
    [#2430](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2430)
-   Fixed a bug where notifications to workers may go unnoticed. This may lead to idle workers while
    there are tasks waiting.
    [#2506](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2506)

### Plugin API

No significant changes.

## 3.17.6 (2022-03-25) {: #3.17.6 }

### REST API

#### Bugfixes

-   Reduced memory usage during tasks like sync by holding fewer objects in-memory unnecessarily.
    [#2069](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2069)
-   Fixes duplicate key error `Key (content_artifact_id, remote_id)` when creating `RemoteArtifacts`
    during syncs in pulp_container and possibly other plugins.
    [#2381](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2381)
-   Declared proper dependency on user model in migration 0040.
    [#2403](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2403)
-   Fixed a rare deadlock when sync'ing overlapping content in high-concurrency envs.
    [#2420](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2420)

### Plugin API

#### Bugfixes

-   Adjusted the default size of the queues between pipelines to be 1 instead of 1000. The batchers in
    the stage will still accumulate up to 500 (by default) items so batching is still in-effect there
    where it matters.
    [#2069](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2069)

## 3.17.5 (2022-03-18) {: #3.17.5 }

### REST API

#### Bugfixes

-   Fix delete repository version causing "duplicate key value violates unique constraint" error.
    [#2047](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2047)

-   Fixed migration 0064_add_new_style_task_columns to purge extraneous ReservedResource and
    TaskReservedResource entries, which could block sync and publish tasks post-upgrade.

    Also taught the migration to bulk-update the Task changes. In large installations, this
    should have a positive impact on the time it takes to apply the migration.
    [#2101](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2101)

-   Taught PulpImport to retry in the event of a concurrency-collision on ContentArtifact.
    [#2102](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2102)

-   This fix prevents the lost track of a content removed version when deleting a repository version that deletes a content that is added back in the subsequent version, but deleted again in a later version.
    [#2267](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2267)

-   Fix a mistake in a previous migration which may have caused improperly encrypted remote fields.
    [#2327](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2327)

### Plugin API

No significant changes.

## 3.17.4 (2022-03-01) {: #3.17.4 }

    [#2094](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2094)

-   Fixed an edge case where the first (streamed) response from an repo synced as "on_demand" could be incorrect.
    [#2119](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2119)

-   Fixed bug where retries of partially downloaded files failed digest and size validation.
    [#2135](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2135)

-   Fixed the calculation of response range headers in streaming answers from the content app.
    [#2147](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2147)

-   Fixed potential deadlock-window in touch() path.
    [#2157](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2157)

-   Fixed reporting tasks being canceled before being picked up by a worker as canceled instead of
    failed.
    [#2183](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2183)

-   Fixed import/export of repositories with sub-content.

    An example would be the sub-repositories in pulp_rpm
    DistributionTrees.
    [#2192](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2192)

-   touch() now uses standard Django instead of raw-sql to update.
    [#2229](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2229)

-   Added transactions around repository version operations to prevent data loss.
    [#2268](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2268)

-   Exposed adjust_roles in the plugin api.
    (backported from #9665)
    [#9668](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9668)

## 3.17.2 (2022-01-06) {: #3.17.2 }

## 3.17.1 (2021-12-21) {: #3.17.1 }

### REST API

#### Bugfixes

-   Fixed migration 0081 to be compatible with custom User models.
    [#9654](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9654)

### Plugin API

No significant changes.

## 3.17.0 (2021-12-14) {: #3.17.0 }

### REST API

#### Features

-   Added a `/tasks/purge/` API to do bulk-deletion of old tasks.

    Over time, the database can fill with task-records. This API allows
    an installation to bulk-remove records based on their completion
    timestamps.

    NOTE: this endpoint is in tech-preview and may change in backwards
    incompatible ways in the future.
    [#8554](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8554)

-   Added a role model to support RBAC and the utility functions `assign_role` and `remove_role`.

    The field `permissions_assignment` of access policies has been renamed to `creation_hooks`. A
    compatibility patch has been added to be removed with pulpcore=3.20.

    The `permissions` argument to `creation_hooks` has been deprecated to be removed with
    pulpcore=3.20.
    [#9411](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9411)

-   Added views to assign model and object level roles to users and groups.
    [#9413](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9413)

-   Rewrote existing access policies on viewsets to use roles.
    [#9415](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9415)

-   Added validation to prevent credentials in remote urls. Also added data migration to move
    credentials out of remote url and into remote username/password fields for existing remotes.
    [#9459](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9459)

-   Reworked RBAC Content Guards to now use roles. Added new endpoints `{list, add, remove}_roles` and `my_permissions` to the RBAC content guard viewset.
    [#9498](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9498)

-   Content-type and Content-disposition headers are now sent in the AzureStorage.url.
    [#9518](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9518)

-   SigningService scripts can now access the public key fingerprint using the `PULP_SIGNING_KEY_FINGERPRINT` environment variable.
    This allows for more generic scripts, that do not need to "guess" (hardcode) what key they should use.
    [#9532](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9532)

-   Added object specific endpoints `{list,add}_roles`, `remove_roles` and `my_permissions` to tasks and groups viewsets.
    [#9604](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9604)

-   Added a `reset` endpoint to the access policy viewset to revert to the provided default uncustomized access policy.
    [#9606](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9606)

#### Bugfixes

-   PulpImporter now unpacks into the task-worker's working directory rather than /tmp. Unpacking
    large files into /tmp could cause the operation to fail, or even cause stability issues for
    Pulp instance, due to running /tmp out of space.
    [#8610](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8610)
-   Missing worker records are now kept in the database for seven days allowing time for post-mortem
    analysis of them. The user-facing data in the status API remains unmodified.
    [#8988](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8988)
-   Made Pulp to be fault-tolerant to Redis server connection issues.
    [#8997](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8997)
-   Cache is now properly invalidated after reclaim disk task.
    [#9215](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9215)
-   Fixed bug where the content app would stop working after a brief loss of connection to the database.
    [#9276](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9276)
-   Improved messaging around timeout requests.
    [#9301](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9301)
-   Updated the distribution validation to properly handle the use of `repository` / `repository_version` / `publication`.
    [#9434](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9434)
-   Fixed issue with listing repository versions while running orphan cleanup task.
    [#9481](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9481)
-   Fixed erroneous ordering filters from appearing in HTML views and causing 500 errors when used.
    [#9496](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9496)
-   Fixed bug where Artifacts were being downloaded even if they were already saved in Pulp.
    [#9542](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9542)
-   Fixed a bug in pulpcore-worker, where wakeup and cancel signals could be lost due to a race
    condition.
    [#9549](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9549)
-   Fixed bug where chunked uploads were being assembled in /tmp.
    [#9550](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9550)
-   Created a proxy model for Groups to allow using creation_hooks with them.
    [#9588](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9588)
-   Fixed permission errors on artifact retrieval from object storage when redis caching is enabled.
    [#9595](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9595)

#### Improved Documentation

-   Adjusted the RBAC documentation for the roles framework.
    [#9411](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9411)
-   Added documentation for `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` setting.
    [#9495](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9495)
-   Fixed the path to uploaded artifacts.
    [#9527](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9527)

#### Removals

-   The `pulpcore-worker` binary no longer accepts the `--resource-manager` flag. There is no
    resource manager anymore, so this flag is no longer needed.
    [#9327](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9327)
-   Removed tech previewed `assign_permission` and `remove_permission` endpoints from RBAC content guard viewset.
    [#9498](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9498)

#### Misc

-   [#9353](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9353), [#9354](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9354), [#9506](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9506)

### Plugin API

#### Features

-   Added `get_objects_for_user` to support queryset filtering by roles.
    Added hooks in `AutoAddObjPermsMixin` to support auto-assignment of roles.

    Changed the lookup for creation hooks so hooks need to be registered in
    `REGISTERED_CREATION_HOOKS` on the model to be used. The signature for creation hooks that are
    registered must match the exploded version of the dict parameters from the access policy.
    Unregistered creation hooks are deprecated and support will be dropped in pulpcore 3.20.
    [#9411](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9411)

-   Made RepositoryAddRemoveContentSerializer available for plugin writers.
    [#9504](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9504)

-   Added ability to pass headers through the AzureStorage.url.
    [#9518](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9518)

-   `Remote.get_remote_artifact_url` now accepts a `request` parameter.
    [#9554](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9554)

-   Added `initialize_new_version` function to `Repository` model.
    [#9579](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9579)

-   DownloaderFactory.user_agent() method is now available if plugin needs to generate User-Agent header value to use in their custom (subclasssed) downloader factory.
    [#9591](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9591)

-   Added ability to use a custom download factory. Remote.get_downloader now accepts a download_factory parameter.
    [#9592](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9592)

-   `Handler._serve_content_artifact` method accepts new positional argument `request`.
    [#9595](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9595)

-   Added Group model to plugin api.
    Added `RolesMixin` to for viewsets to allow managing object roles based on permissions.
    [#9604](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9604)

-   Added new async sign method `asign` to the `SigningService` model.
    [#9615](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9615)

-   `SigningService.sign` and `SigningService.asign` now accepts a `env_var` parameter that makes
    it possible to pass environment variables to the signing script.
    [#9621](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9621)

#### Bugfixes

-   Include additional information about which AccessPolicy is using deprecated policy features.

## 3.16.8 (2022-05-10) {: #3.16.8 }

### REST API

#### Bugfixes

-   Taught PulpImport to stream imports rather than reading files into memory in one chunk.

    This largely alleviates the memory-pressure that results from importing multiple
    large repositories in parallel.
    [#2307](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2307)

-   Fixed does_batch method in sync pipeline to allow waiting on content that is already resolved.
    [#2557](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2557)

-   Ensure downloader resets file on retry.
    [#2576](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2576)

-   Taught PulpImport to retry more than once in the event of creation-collisions.

    This fixes a rare import-failure during high-concurrency, high-content-overlap imports.
    [#2589](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2589)

-   Improved the error message when HTTP proxies reject requests from Pulp.

    [#2061](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2061)
-   Fixed file descriptior leak during upload.
    [#2087](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2087)

    condition.
    [#2144](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2144)
-   Loosened the version-restrictions on PulpImport to only require X.Y matching.
    [#2269](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2269)
-   Fixed a (rare) deadlock around bulk_update() during syncs with overlapping content.
    [#2430](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2430)
-   Fixed a bug where notifications to workers may go unnoticed. This may lead to idle workers while
    there are tasks waiting.

    [#2069](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2069)
-   Fixes duplicate key error `Key (content_artifact_id, remote_id)` when creating `RemoteArtifacts`
    during syncs in pulp_container and possibly other plugins.
    [#2381](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2381)
-   Declared proper dependency on user model in migration 0040.
    [#2403](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2403)
-   Fixed a rare deadlock when sync'ing overlapping content in high-concurrency envs.
    [#2420](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2420)
-   Fixed secure proxy support by updating aiohttp version to ~=3.8.1.
    [#2423](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2423)

### Plugin API

#### Bugfixes

-   Adjusted the default size of the queues between pipelines to be 1 instead of 1000. The batchers in
    the stage will still accumulate up to 500 (by default) items so batching is still in-effect there
    where it matters.
    [#2069](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2069)

## 3.16.5 (2022-03-17) {: #3.16.5 }

### REST API

#### Bugfixes

-   Fix delete repository version causing "duplicate key value violates unique constraint" error.
    [#2047](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2047)

-   Fixed migration 0064_add_new_style_task_columns to purge extraneous ReservedResource and
    TaskReservedResource entries, which could block sync and publish tasks post-upgrade.

    Also taught the migration to bulk-update the Task changes. In large installations, this
    should have a positive impact on the time it takes to apply the migration.
    [#2101](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2101)

-   Taught PulpImport to retry in the event of a concurrency-collision on ContentArtifact.
    [#2102](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2102)

-   This fix prevents the lost track of a content removed version when deleting a repository version that deletes a content that is added back in the subsequent version, but deleted again in a later version.
    [#2267](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2267)

-   Fix a mistake in a previous migration which may have caused improperly encrypted remote fields.

-   Fixed potential deadlock-window in touch() path.
    [#2157](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2157)

-   Fixed import/export of repositories with sub-content.

    An example would be the sub-repositories in pulp_rpm
    DistributionTrees.
    [#2192](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2192)

-   touch() now uses standard Django instead of raw-sql to update.
    [#2229](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2229)

-   PulpImporter now unpacks into the task-worker's working directory rather than /tmp. Unpacking
    large files into /tmp could cause the operation to fail, or even cause stability issues for
    Pulp instance, due to running /tmp out of space.
    [#2247](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2247)

-   Added transactions around repository version operations to prevent data loss.

    [#8951](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8951)
-   A new setting `ALLOW_SHARED_TASK_RESOURCES` was temporarily added to allow plugins to use specific
    resources concurrently, during task execution. It defaults to `False`. It will switch to `True`
    with 3.16 and will eventually be removed.
    [#9148](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9148)

#### Bugfixes

-   In stages-pipeline and new-version sanity-checks, added full error-info on path-problems.
    [#8133](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8133)

    [#8779](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8779)
-   Fixed bug where content app would not respond to `Range` HTTP Header in requests when
    `remote.policy` was either `on_demand` or `streamed`. For example this request is used by
    Anaconda clients.
    [#8865](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8865)
-   Unpublished content can no longer be accessed from content app if publication based-plugin has
    defined their distributions as publication serving
    [#8870](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8870)
-   Fixed a bug that caused a serializer to ignore form data for `pulp_labels`.
    [#8954](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8954)
-   Fixed inability for users to disable RBAC at the settings level by changing the
    `DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES` like any user configuring a DRF project expects to.
    [#8974](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8974)
-   Fixed signal handling to properly kill a task when double ctrl-c is used to shut down a worker fast.
    [#8986](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8986)
-   Added an attempt to cancel a task if a worker needed to abort it on graceful shutdown.
    [#8987](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8987)
-   Fixed a bug where on-demand downloads would fill up `/var/run/` by not deleting downloaded files.

-   Fixed a regression preventing syncs from <file://> urls.
    [#9003](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9003)

    [#9008](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9008)
-   Use proxy auth from Remote config to download content from a remote repository.
    [#9024](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9024)
-   Fixed the behavior of setting "repository" on a distribution for publication-based plugins.
    [#9039](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9039)
-   Set Redis connection information in status to null unless it's used. Redis is
    needed for RQ tasking or content caching.
    [#9070](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9070)
-   Fixed server error when accessing invalid files from content app base directory
    [#9074](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9074)

    [#9249](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9249)
-   Fixed another occurence of the HTTP 500 error and connection already closed in the logs while accessing content.
    [#9275](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9275)

#### Removals

-   Dropped support for Python 3.6 and 3.7. Pulp now supports Python 3.8+.
    [#8855](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8855)
-   Renamed the `retained_versions` field on repositories to `retain_repo_versions`.
    [#9030](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9030)

#### Deprecations

-   The traditional tasking system (formerly the default in `pulpcore<=3.13`) is deprecated and
    will be removed in `pulpcore==3.16`. If you are using the `USE_NEW_WORKER_TYPE=False` that
    will no longer give you the traditional tasking system starting with `pulpcore==3.16`.

### Plugin API

#### Features

-   Content model has a new boolean class constant `PROTECTED_FROM_RECLAIM` for plugins to enable the
    reclaim disk space feature provided by core.
    [#8459](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8459)
-   Added endpoints for managing Alternate Content Sources.
    [#8607](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8607)
-   Orphan cleanup task has a new optional parameter `orphan_protection_time` that decides for how
    long Pulp will hold orphan Content and Artifacts before they become candidates for deletion for this
    particular orphan cleanup task.
    [#8824](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8824)
-   Distribution model has a new boolean class variable `SERVE_FROM_PUBLICATION` for plugins to declare
    whether their distributions serve from publications or directly from repository versions
    [#8870](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8870)
-   The settings file switched `DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES` to use `AccessPolicyFromDB` instead of
    `IsAdminUser` with a fallback to a behavior of `IsAdminUser`. With this feature plugin writers
    no longer need to declare `permission_classes` on their Views or Viewsets to use
    `AccessPolicyFromDB`.
    [#8974](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8974)
-   Upgraded django from 2.2 to 3.2.
    [#9018](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9018)
-   pulpcore.plugin.models.ProgressReport now has async interfaces: asave(), aincrease_by(),
    aincrement(), __aenter__(), _aexit__(). Plugins should switch to the async interfaces in their
    Stages.
    pulpcore.plugin.sync.sync_to_async_iterator is a utility method to synchronize the database
    queries generated when a QuerySet is iterated.
    [#9129](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9129)
-   Added `shared_resources` to the `dispatch` call, so tasks can run concurrently if they need overlapping resources for read only.
    [#9148](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9148)
-   Added `touch` to Artifact and Content query sets for bulk operation.
    [#9234](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9234)
-   Added ContentManager to the plugin API - all subclasses of Content that add their own custom manager should have the manager subclass ContentManager.
    [#9269](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9269)

#### Bugfixes

-   Added kwarg to RemoteArtifactSaver init to allow enabling handling of rare error edge-case.

    fix_mismatched_remote_artifacts=True enables workaround for a failure-scenario that
    (so far) is only encountered by pulp_rpm. Current behavior is the default.
    [#8133](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8133)

#### Removals

-   Removed the `pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.NewDistributionFilter`. Instead use
    `pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.DistributionFilter`.
    [#8479](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8479)
-   Removed `FilesystemExporterSerializer` and `PublicationExportSerializer` from the plugin api.
    Filesystem exports are now handled by pulpcore.
    [#8860](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8860)
-   The `pulpcore.plugin.download.http_giveup` method has been removed from the plugin API. Plugins
    used to have to use this to wrap the `_run` method defined on subclasses of `HttpDownloader`,
    but starting with pulpcore 3.14 the backoff is implemented directly in the `HttpDownloader.run()`
    method which subclasses do not override. Due to `pulpcore` implementing it, it is no longer needed
    or available for plugins to use.
    [#8913](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8913)

#### Deprecations

-   ContentSaver._pre_save() and ContentSaver._post_save() hooks are no longer coroutines. They should
    be implemented as synchronous functions.
    [#9129](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9129)
-   Deprecate the compatibility layer for access policies. As of pulpcore 3.16, all plugins should
    properly use the "condition" and "condition_expression" fields in the access policy statements.
    [#9160](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9160)
-   Deprecate the `resources` argument of `dispatch` in favor of `exclusive_resources` and `shared_resources`.
    [#9257](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9257)

## 3.14.18 (2022-07-14) {: #3.14.18 }

### REST API

#### Bugfixes

-   Started showing errors when users try to export remote artifacts.
    [#2817](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2817)
-   Restore multiple-retry logic for PulpImport.
    [#2854](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2854)
-   Configured aiohttp to avoid rewriting redirect URLs, as some web servers (e.g. Amazon CloudFront) can be tempermental about the encoding of the URL.
    [#2964](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2964)

### Plugin API

No significant changes.

## 3.14.17 (2022-05-09) {: #3.14.17 }

### REST API

#### Bugfixes

-   Loosened the version-restrictions on PulpImport to only require X.Y matching.
    [#2269](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2269)

-   Taught PulpImport to stream imports rather than reading files into memory in one chunk.

    This largely alleviates the memory-pressure that results from importing multiple
    large repositories in parallel.
    [#2307](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2307)

-   Ensure downloader resets file on retry.
    [#2576](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2576)

-   Taught PulpImport to retry more than once in the event of creation-collisions.

    This fixes a rare import-failure during high-concurrency, high-content-overlap imports.
    [#2589](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2589)

### Plugin API

No significant changes.

## 3.14.16 (2022-04-12) {: #3.14.16 }

### REST API

#### Bugfixes

-   Fixed two instances of Pulp not writing to the task worker's temporary directory.
    [#2061](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2061)
-   Fixed a (rare) deadlock around bulk_update() during syncs with overlapping content.
    [#2430](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2430)
-   Fixed a bug where notifications to workers may go unnoticed. This may lead to idle workers while
    there are tasks waiting.
    [#2506](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2506)

### Plugin API

## 3.14.15 (2022-03-25) {: #3.14.15 }

### REST API

#### Bugfixes

-   Fix delete repository version causing "duplicate key value violates unique constraint" error.
    [#2047](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2047)
-   Reduced memory usage during tasks like sync by holding fewer objects in-memory unnecessarily.
    [#2069](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2069)
-   This fix prevents the lost track of a content removed version when deleting a repository version that deletes a content that is added back in the subsequent version, but deleted again in a later version.
    [#2267](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2267)
-   Fixes duplicate key error `Key (content_artifact_id, remote_id)` when creating `RemoteArtifacts`
    during syncs in pulp_container and possibly other plugins.
    [#2381](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2381)
-   Declared proper dependency on user model in migration 0040.
    [#2403](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2403)
-   Fixed a rare deadlock when sync'ing overlapping content in high-concurrency envs.
    [#2420](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2420)

### Plugin API

#### Bugfixes

-   Adjusted the default size of the queues between pipelines to be 1 instead of 1000. The batchers in
    the stage will still accumulate up to 500 (by default) items so batching is still in-effect there
    where it matters.
    [#2069](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2069)

## 3.14.14 (2022-03-10) {: #3.14.14 }

### REST API

#### Bugfixes

-   Fixed migration 0064_add_new_style_task_columns to purge extraneous ReservedResource and
    TaskReservedResource entries, which could block sync and publish tasks post-upgrade.

    Also taught the migration to bulk-update the Task changes. In large installations, this
    should have a positive impact on the time it takes to apply the migration.

    [#2102](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2102)

-   Fixed import/export of repositories with sub-content.

    An example would be the sub-repositories in pulp_rpm
    DistributionTrees.
    [#2192](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2192)

-   touch() now uses standard Django instead of raw-sql to update.
    [#2229](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2229)

-   PulpImporter now unpacks into the task-worker's working directory rather than /tmp. Unpacking
    large files into /tmp could cause the operation to fail, or even cause stability issues for
    Pulp instance, due to running /tmp out of space.
    [#2247](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/issues/2247)

## 3.14.12 (2022-02-11) {: #3.14.12 }

## 3.14.0 (2021-07-01) {: #3.14.0 }

### REST API

#### Features

-   Introduce new worker style. (tech-preview)
    [#8501](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8501)

-   Added new endpoint `/pulp/api/v3/orphans/cleanup/`. When called with `POST` and no parameters
    it is equivalent to calling `DELETE /pulp/api/v3/orphans/`. Additionally the optional parameter
    `content_hrefs` can be specified and must contain a list of content hrefs. When `content_hrefs`
    is specified, only those content units will be considered to be removed by orphan cleanup.
    [#8658](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8658)

-   Content app responses are now smartly cached in Redis.
    [#8805](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8805)

-   Downloads from remote sources will now be retried on more kinds of errors, such as HTTP 500 or socket errors.
    [#8881](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8881)

-   Add a correlation id filter to the task list endpoint.
    [#8891](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8891)

-   Where before `download_concurrency` would previously be set to a default value upon creation, it will now be set NULL (but a default value will still be used).
    [#8897](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8897)

-   Added graceful shutdown to pulpcore workers.
    [#8930](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8930)

-   Activate the new task worker type by default.

    ::: warning
    ::: title

    [#8948](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8948)

#### Bugfixes

-   Fixed race condition where a task could clean up reserved resources shared with another task.
    [#8637](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8637)

-   Altered redirect URL escaping, preventing invalidation of signed URLs for artifacts using cloud storage.
    [#8670](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8670)

-   Add an update row lock on in task dispatching for `ReservedResource` to prevent a race where an
    object was deleted that was supposed to be reused. This prevents a condition where tasks ended up in
    waiting state forever.
    [#8708](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8708)

-   Retry downloads on `ClientConnectorSSLError`, which appears to be spuriously returned by some CDNs.
    [#8867](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8867)

-   Fixed OpenAPI schema tag generation for resources that are nested more than 2 levels.

    This change is most evident in client libraries generated from the OpenAPI schema.

    Prior to this change, the API client for a resource located at
    [/api/v3/pulp/exporters/core/pulp/<uuid>/exports/]{.title-ref} was named ExportersCoreExportsApi.

    After this change, the API client for a resource located at
    [/api/v3/pulp/exporters/core/pulp/<uuid>/exports/]{.title-ref} is named ExportersPulpExportsApi.
    [#8868](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8868)

-   Fixed request schema for `/pulp/api/v3/repair/`, which did identify any arguments. This also fixes
    the bindings.
    [#8869](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8869)

-   Update default access policies in the database if they were unmodified by the administrator.
    [#8883](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8883)

-   Pinning to psycopg2 < 2.9 as psycopg 2.9 doesn't work with django 2.2. More info at
    <https://github.com/django/django/commit/837ffcfa681d0f65f444d881ee3d69aec23770be>.
    [#8926](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8926)

-   Fixed bug where artifacts and content were not always saved in Pulp with each
    on_demand request serviced by content app.
    [#8980](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8980)

#### Improved Documentation

    [#6837](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/6837)
-   Added a troubleshooting section to the docs explaining how to find stuck tasks.
    [#8774](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8774)
-   Moved existing basic auth docs to a new top-level section named Authentication.
    [#8800](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8800)
-   Moved `Webserver Authentication` docs under the top-level `Authentication` section.
    [#8801](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8801)
-   Provide instructions to use Keycloak authenication using Python Social Aauth
    [#8803](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8803)
-   Updated the docs.pulpproject.org to provide some immediate direction for better user orientation.
    [#8946](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8946)
-   Separated hardware and Filesystem information from the Architecture section and added them to the Installation section.
    [#8947](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8947)
-   Added sub-headings and simplified language of Pulp concept section.
    [#8949](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8949)

#### Deprecations

-   Deprecated the `DELETE /pulp/api/v3/orphans/` call. Instead use the
    `POST /pulp/api/v3/orphans/cleanup/` call.
    [#8876](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8876)

#### Misc

-   [#8821](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8821), [#8827](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8827), [#8975](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8975)

### Plugin API

#### Features

-   Added the `pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.DistributionFilter`. This should be used instead of
    `pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.NewDistributionFilter`.
    [#8480](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8480)
-   Added `user_hidden` field to `Repository` to hide repositories from users.
    [#8487](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8487)
-   Added a `timestamp_of_interest` field to Content and Artifacts. This field can be updated by
    calling a new method `touch()` on Artifacts and Content. Plugin writers should call this method
    whenever they deal with Content or Artifacts. For example, this includes places where Content is
    uploaded or added to Repository Versions. This will prevent Content and Artifacts from being cleaned
    up when orphan cleanup becomes a non-blocking task in pulpcore 3.15.
    [#8823](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8823)
-   Exposed `AsyncUpdateMixin` through `pulpcore.plugin.viewsets`.
    [#8844](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8844)
-   Added a field `DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES` to the `Remote` base class - plugin writers can override the default number of retries attempted when file downloads failed for each type of remote. The default value is 3.
    [#8881](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8881)
-   Added a field `DEFAULT_DOWNLOAD_CONCURRENCY` to the Remote base class - plugin writers can override the number of concurrent downloads for each type of remote. The default value is 10.
    [#8897](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8897)

#### Bugfixes

-   Fixed OpenAPI schema tag generation for resources that are nested more than 2 levels.

    This change is most evident in client libraries generated from the OpenAPI schema.

    Prior to this change, the API client for a resource located at
    [/api/v3/pulp/exporters/core/pulp/<uuid>/exports/]{.title-ref} was named ExportersCoreExportsApi.

    After this change, the API client for a resource located at
    [/api/v3/pulp/exporters/core/pulp/<uuid>/exports/]{.title-ref} is named ExportersPulpExportsApi.
    [#8868](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8868)

#### Removals

-   The usage of non-JSON serializable types of `args` and `kwargs` to tasks is no longer supported.
    `uuid.UUID` objects however will silently be converted to `str`.
    [#8501](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8501)
-   Removed the `versions_containing_content` method from the
    pulpcore.plugin.models.RepositoryVersion object. Instead use
    RepositoryVersion.objects.with_content().
    #8729 <<https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8729>>`__
-   Removed pulpcore.plugin.stages.ContentUnassociation from the plugin API.
    [#8827](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8827)

#### Deprecations

-   The `pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.NewDistributionFilter` is deprecated and will be removed from a
    future release. Instead use `pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.DistributionFilter`.
    [#8480](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8480)
-   Deprecate the use of the reserved_resources_record__resource in favor of reserved_resources_record__contains.
    Tentative removal release is pulpcore==3.15.
    [#8501](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8501)
-   Plugin writers who create custom downloaders by subclassing `HttpDownloader` no longer need to wrap the `_run()` method with a `backoff` decorator. Consequntly the `http_giveup` handler the sake of the `backoff` decorator is no longer needed and has been deprecated. It is likely to be removed in pulpcore 3.15.
    [#8881](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8881)

## 3.13.0 (2021-05-25) {: #3.13.0 }

    [#8499](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8499)

#### Misc

-   [#8450](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8450)

### Plugin API

#### Features

-   Added a new callback method to `Repository` named `on_new_version()`, which runs when a new repository version has been created. This can be used for e.g. automatically publishing or distributing a new repository version after it has been created.
    [#7626](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7626)

-   Added url as optional argument to `DigestValidationError` and `SizeValidationError` exceptions to log urls in the exception message.
    [#8357](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8357)

-   Added the following new objects related to a new `Distribution` MasterModel:

    * `pulpcore.plugin.models.Distribution` - A new MasterModel `Distribution` which replaces the
    `pulpcore.plugin.models.BaseDistribution`. This now contains the `repository`,
    `repository_version`, and `publication` fields on the MasterModel instead of on the detail
    models as was done with `pulpcore.plugin.models.BaseDistribution`.

    * `pulpcore.plugin.serializer.DistributionSerializer` - A serializer plugin writers should use
    with the new `pulpcore.plugin.models.Distribution`.

    * `pulpcore.plugin.viewset.DistributionViewSet` - The viewset that replaces the deprecated
    `pulpcore.plugin.viewset.BaseDistributionViewSet`.

    * `pulpcore.plugin.viewset.NewDistributionFilter` - The filter that pairs with the
    `Distribution` model.
    [#8384](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8384)

-   Added checksum type enforcement to `pulpcore.plugin.download.BaseDownloader`.
    [#8435](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8435)

-   Adds the `pulpcore.plugin.tasking.dispatch` interface which replaces the
    `pulpcore.plugin.tasking.enqueue_with_reservation` interface. It is the same except:

    -   It returns a `pulpcore.plugin.models.Task` instead of an RQ object
    -   It does not support the `options` keyword argument

    Additionally the `pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.OperationPostponedResponse` was updated to support both
    the `dispatch` and `enqueue_with_reservation` interfaces.
    [#8496](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8496)

#### Bugfixes

-   Allow plugins to unset the `queryset_filtering_required_permission` attribute in `NamedModelViewSet`.
    [#8438](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8438)

#### Removals

-   Removed checksum type filtering from `pulpcore.plugin.models.Remote.get_downloader` and `pulpcore.plugin.stages.DeclarativeArtifact.download`.
    [#8435](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8435)

#### Deprecations

    * `pulpcore.plugin.viewset.BaseDistributionViewSet` -- Instead use
    `pulpcore.plugin.viewset.DistributionViewSet`.

    * `pulpcore.plugin.serializer.BaseDistributionSerializer` -- Instead use
    `pulpcore.plugin.serializer.DistributionSerializer`.

    * `pulpcore.plugin.serializer.PublicationDistributionSerializer` -- Instead use define the

    [#8385](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8385)

-   Deprecated the `pulpcore.plugin.tasking.enqueue_with_reservation`. Instead use the
    `pulpcore.plugin.tasking.dispatch` interface.
    [#8496](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8496)

-   The usage of non-JSON serializable types of `args` and `kwargs` to tasks is deprecated. Future
    releases of pulpcore may discontinue accepting complex argument types. Note, UUID objects are not
    JSON serializable. A deprecated warning is logged if a non-JSON serializable is used.

    [#8444](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8444)

## 3.11.0 (2021-03-15) {: #3.11.0 }

### REST API

#### Features

-   Raise error when syncing content with a checksum not included in `ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS`.
    [#7854](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7854)
-   User can evaluate how many content units are affected with checksum type change with 'pulpcore-manager handle-artifact-checksums --report'.
    [#7986](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7986)
-   The fields `proxy_username` and `proxy_password` have been added to remotes.
    Credentials can no longer be specified as part of the `proxy_url`.
    A data migration will move the proxy auth information on existing remotes to the new fields.
    [#8167](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8167)
-   Added the `WORKER_TTL` setting, that specifies the interval a worker is considered missing after its last heartbeat.
    [#8291](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8291)
-   Due to the removal of `md5` and `sha1` from the `ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS` setting, every
    system that had any Artifacts synced in in prior to 3.11 will have to run the `pulpcore-manager handle-content-checksums` command. A data migration is provided with 3.11 that will run this
    automatically as part of the `pulpcore-manager migrate` command all upgrades must run anyway.
    [#8322](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8322)

#### Bugfixes

-   Fixed a bug experienced by the migration plugin where all content objects are assumed to have a
    remote associated with them.
    [#7876](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7876)

-   Restored inadvertently-changed content-guards API to its correct endpoint.

    In the process of adding generic list-endpoints, the /pulp/api/v3/contentguards
    API was inadvertently rehomed to /pulp/api/v3/content_guards. This change restores
    it to its published value.
    [#8283](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8283)

-   Added headers field to the list of fields in the `RemoteSerializer` base class and marked it optional to make it accessible via the REST api.
    [#8330](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8330)

-   Fixed AccessPolicy AttributeError.
    [#8395](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8395)

#### Improved Documentation

-   Removed correlation id feature from tech preview.
    [#7927](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7927)

-   Removed 'tech preview' label from `handle-artifact-checksums` command.

    `handle-artifact-checksums` is now a fully-supported part of Pulp3.
    [#7928](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7928)

-   Added a warning banner to the `ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS` setting section indicating the setting
    is not fully enforcing in `pulpcore` code and various plugins.
    [#8342](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8342)

#### Removals

-   The `component` field of the `versions` section of the status API `` `/pulp/api/v3/status/ `` now
    lists the Django app name, not the Python package name. Similarly the OpenAPI schema at
    `/pulp/api/v3` does also.
    [#8198](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8198)
-   Removed sensitive fields `username`, `password`, and `client_key` from Remote responses. These
    fields can still be set and updated but will no longer be readable.
    [#8202](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8202)
-   Adjusted the `ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS` setting to remove `md5` and `sha1` since they are
    insecure. Now, by default, the `ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS` contain `sha224`, `sha256`,
    `sha384`, and `sha512`.
    [#8246](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8246)

#### Misc

-   [#7797](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7797), [#7984](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7984), [#8315](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8315)

### Plugin API

#### Features

-   Allow developers to use more than one WorkingDirectory() within a task, including nested calls. Tasks will also now use a temporary working directory by default.
    [#7815](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7815)
-   Added the `pulpcore.app.pulp_hashlib` module which provides the `new` function and ensures only
    allowed hashers listed in `ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS` can be instantiated. Plugin writers should
    use this instead of `hashlib.new` to generate checksum hashers.
    [#7984](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7984)
-   Add a `get_content` method to `pulpcore.plugin.models.RepositoryVersion` that accepts a
    queryset and returns a list of content in that repository using the given queryset.
    This allows for specific content type to be returned by executing
    `repo_version.get_content(content_qs=MyContentType.objects)`.
    [#8375](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8375)

#### Improved Documentation

-   Added docs identifying plugin writers to use the `pulpcore.app.pulp_hashlib` module which provides
    the `new` function and ensures only allowed hashers can be instantiated. This should be used in
    place of `hashlib.new`.
    [#7984](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7984)
-   The use of `tempdir.TemporaryDirectory` in tasks has been documented.
    [#8231](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8231)

#### Removals

-   Adjusted the `ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS` setting to remove `md5` and `sha1` since they are
    insecure. Now, by default, the `ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS` contain `sha224`, `sha256`,
    `sha384`, and `sha512`.
    [#8246](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8246)
-   Removed unused get_plugin_storage_path method.
    [#8343](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8343)
-   It is not longer possible to address AccessPolicy via the viewset's classname. Viewset's urlpattern should be used instead.
    [#8397](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8397)
-   Removed deprecated key field returned by the signing service.
    Plugin writers must now refer directly to the public_key field on the signing service object.
    [#8398](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8398)

#### Deprecations

-   `pulpcore.plugin.tasking.WorkingDirectory` has been deprecated.
    [#8231](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8231)

## 3.10.0 (2021-02-04) {: #3.10.0 }

### REST API

#### Features

-   Change the default deployment layout

    This changes the default deployment layout. The main change is that MEDIA_ROOT gets its own
    directory. This allows limiting the file permissions in a shared Pulp 2 + Pulp 3 deployment and the
    SELinux file contexts. Another benefit is compatibility with django_extensions' unreferenced_files
    command which lists all files in MEDIA_ROOT that are not in the database.

    Other paths are kept on the same absolute paths. The documentation is updated to show the latest
    best practices.
    [#7178](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7178)

-   Added general endpoints to list `Content`, `ContentGuards`, and `Repositories`.
    [#7204](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7204)

-   Added /importers/core/pulp/import-check/ to validate import-parameters.
    [#7549](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7549)

-   Added a new field called public_key to SigningService. This field preserves the value of the public
    key. In addition to that, the field fingerprint was introduced as well. This field identifies the
    public key.
    [#7700](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7700)

-   Added possibility to filter users and groups by various fields.
    [#7975](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7975)

-   Added pulp_labels to allow users to add key/value data to objects.
    [#8065](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8065)

-   Added `pulp_label_select` filter to allow users to filter by labels.
    [#8067](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8067)

-   Added optional headers field to the aiohttp ClientSession.
    [#8083](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8083)

-   Allow querying names on the api using name__icontains, name__contains and name__startswith query parameters.
    [#8094](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8094)

-   Added RBAC to the endpoint for managing groups.
    [#8159](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8159)

-   Added RBAC to the endpoint for managing group users.
    [#8160](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8160)

-   Added the `AccessPolicy.customized` field which if `True` indicates a user has modified the
    default AccessPolicy.
    [#8182](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8182)

-   Added filtering for access policies.
    [#8189](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8189)

-   As an authenticated user I can create and view artifacts.
    [#8193](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8193)

#### Bugfixes

-   Fixed bug where duplicate artifact error message was nondeterministic in displaying different error
    messages with different checksum types. Also, updated duplicate artifact error message to be more
    descriptive.
    [#3387](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/3387)
-   Fixed Pulp import/export bug that occurs when sha384 or sha512 is not in `ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS`.
    [#7836](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7836)
-   X-CSRFToken is not sent through ajax requests (PUT) in api.html. Fixed by setting the right value in
    the JS code.
    [#7888](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7888)
-   Provide a mechanism to automatically resolve issues and prevent deadlocks when Redis experiences data loss (such as a restart).
    [#7912](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7912)
-   Silence unnecessary log messages from django_guid which were spamming up the logs.
    [#7982](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7982)
-   Changed the default permission class to `IsAdminUser` to protect endpoints not yet guarded by an access policy from users without permission.
    [#8018](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8018)
-   Fixed apidoc bug, where model and object permissions on groups overlapped.
    [#8033](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8033)
-   Fixed the viewset_name used by access policy for the cases when parent_viewset is involved.
    [#8152](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8152)
-   Made the viewset_name property of access policies read only.
    [#8185](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8185)

#### Improved Documentation

-   Added a description of the common filesystem layout in the deployment section.
    [#7750](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7750)
-   Updated the reference to the new location of pulplift at the installer repository in the development section.
    [#7878](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7878)
-   Add links to plugin docs into docs.pulpproject.org.
    [#8131](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8131)
-   Added documentation for labels.
    [#8157](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8157)

#### Misc

-   [#8203](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8203)

### Plugin API

#### Features

-   Add `rate_limit` option to `Remote`
    [#7965](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7965)
-   Made DistributionFilter accessible to plugin writers.
    [#8059](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8059)
-   Adding `Label` and `LabelSerializer` to the plugin api.
    [#8065](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8065)
-   Added `LabelSelectFilter` to filter resources by labels.
    [#8067](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8067)
-   Added ReadOnlyRepositoryViewset to the plugin API.
    [#8103](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8103)
-   Added NAME_FILTER_OPTIONS to the plugin API to gain more consistency across plugins when filter by name or similar CharFields.
    [#8117](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8117)
-   Added has_repo_attr_obj_perms and has_repo_attr_model_or_obj_perms to the global access checks available to all plugins to use.
    [#8161](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8161)

#### Removals

-   Plugins are required to define a `version` attribute on their subclass of
    `PulpPluginAppConfig`. Starting with pulpcore==3.10, if undefined while Pulp loads, Pulp will
    refuse to start.
    [#7930](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7930)
-   Changed the default permission class to from `IsAuthenticated` to `IsAdminUser`.
    Any endpoints that should be accessible by all known to the system users need to specify the permission_classes accordingly.
    [#8018](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8018)
-   `pulpcore.plugin.models.UnsupportedDigestValidationError` has been removed. Plugins should
    look for this at `pulpcore.plugin.exceptions.UnsupportedDigestValidationError` instead.
    [#8169](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8169)

#### Deprecations

-   Access to the path of the public key of a signing service was deprecated. The value of the public
    key is now expected to be saved in the model instance as `SigningService.public_key`.
    [#7700](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7700)
-   The `pulpcore.plugin.storage.get_plugin_storage_path()` method has been deprecated.
    [#7935](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7935)

## 3.9.1 (2021-01-21) {: #3.9.1 }

### REST API

#### Removals

-   CHUNKED_UPLOAD_DIR was converted to a relative path inside MEDIA_ROOT.
    [#8099](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8099)

### Plugin API

No significant changes.

## 3.9.0 (2020-12-07) {: #3.9.0 }

### REST API

#### Features

-   Made uploaded chunks to be stored as separate files in the default storage. This feature removes
    the need for a share storage of pulp api nodes, as the chunks are now stored individually in the
    shared storage and are therefore accessible by all nodes.
    [#4498](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/4498)

-   Add support for logging messages with a correlation id that can either be autogenerated or passed in
    with a `Correlation-ID` header. This feature is provided as a tech preview in pulpcore 3.9.
    [#4689](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/4689)

-   Added progress reporting for pulp imports.
    [#6559](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/6559)

-   Exposed `aiohttp.ClientTimeout` fields in `Remote` as `connect_timeout`,
    `sock_connect_timeout`, `sock_read_timeout`, and `total_timeout`.

    This replaces the previous hard-coded 600 second timeout for sock_connect and sock_read,
    giving per-`Remote` control of all four `ClientTimeout` fields to the user.
    [#7201](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7201)

-   Enabled users to add checksums to ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS by allowing them to populate checksums
    with handle-artifact-checksums command.
    [#7561](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7561)

-   Added version information to api docs.
    [#7569](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7569)

-   Made signing services to be immutable. This requires content signers to create a new signing
    service explicitly when a change occurs.
    [#7701](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7701)

-   Added support for repairing Pulp by detecting and redownloading missing or corrupted artifact files. Sending a POST request to `/pulp/api/v3/repair/` will trigger a task that scans all artifacts for missing and corrupted files in Pulp storage, and will attempt to redownload them from the original remote. Specifying `verify_checksums=False` when POSTing to the same endpoint will skip checking the hashes of the files (corruption detection) and will instead just look for missing files.

    The `verify_checksums` POST parameter was added to the existing "repository version repair" endpoint as well.
    [#7755](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7755)

-   Added check to prevent Pulp to start if there are Artifacts with forbidden checksums.
    [#7914](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7914)

#### Bugfixes

-   Fixed a serious bug data integrity bug where some Artifact files could be silently deleted from storage in specific circumstances.
    [#7676](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7676)
-   Moved the initial creation of access_policies to post_migrate signal.
    This enforces their existance both with migrate and flush.
    [#7710](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7710)
-   Fixed incremental export to happen if start_version provided, even if last_export is null.
    [#7716](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7716)
-   Fixed a file descriptor leak during repository version repair operations.
    [#7735](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7735)
-   Fixed bug where exporter directory existed and was writable but not owned by worker process and thus
    not chmod-able.
    [#7829](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7829)
-   Properly namespaced the viewset_name in AccessPolicy to avoid naming conflicts in plugins.
    [#7845](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7845)
-   Update jquery version from 3.3.1 to 3.5.1 in API.html template. It is the version provided by djangorestframework~=3.12.2
    [#7850](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7850)
-   Prevented a Redis failure scenario from causing the tasking system to back up due to "tasking system
    locks" not being released, even on worker restart.
    [#7907](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7907)
-   Use subclassed plugin downloaders during the pulp repair.
    [#7909](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7909)

#### Improved Documentation

-   Added requirement to record a demo with PRs of substantial change.
    [#7703](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7703)
-   Removed outdated reference stating Pulp did not have an SELinux policy.
    [#7793](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7793)

#### Removals

-   The local file system directory used for uploaded chunks is specified by the setting
    CHUNKED_UPLOAD_DIR. Users are encouraged to remove all uncommitted uploaded files before
    applying this change.
    [#4498](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/4498)

#### Misc

-   [#7690](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7690), [#7753](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7753), [#7902](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7902), [#7890](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7890)

### Plugin API

#### Features

-   Added pre_save hook to Artifact to enforce checksum rules implied by ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS.
    [#7696](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7696)
-   Enabled plugin writers to retrieve a request object from a serializer when look ups are
    performed from within the task serializer.
    [#7718](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7718)
-   Expose ProgressReportSerializer through pulpcore.plugin
    [#7759](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7759)
-   Allowed plugin writers to access the models Upload and UploadChunk
    [#7833](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7833)
-   Exposed `pulpcore.plugin.constants.ALL_KNOWN_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS`.
    [#7897](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7897)
-   Added `UnsupportedDigestValidationError` to `pulpcore.plugins.exceptions`. Going
    forward, plugin authors can expect to find all unique exceptions under
    `pulpcore.plugin.exceptions`.
    [#7908](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7908)

#### Deprecations

-   Plugins are encouraged to define a `version` attribute on their subclass of
    `PulpPluginAppConfig`. If undefined while Pulp loads a warning is now shown to encourage plugin
    writers to implement this attribute, which will be required starting in pulpcore==3.10.
    [#6671](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/6671)

-   Using the ViewSet's classname to identify its AccessPolicy has been deprecated and is slated for removal in 3.10.
    Instead the urlpattern is supposed to be used.

    Plugins with existing AccessPolicies should add a data migration to rename their AccessPolicies:

    ::

    :   access_policy = AccessPolicy.get(viewset_name="MyViewSet")
        access_policy.viewset_name = "objectclass/myplugin/myclass"
        access_policy.save()

    [#7845](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7845)

-   The `pulpcore.plugin.models.UnsupportedDigestValidationError` is being deprecated and
    will be removed in 3.10.

    It can now be found at `pulpcore.plugin.exceptions.UnsupportedDigestValidationError`
    instead; please change any code that imports it to access it from its new location.

    [#6342](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/6342)

#### Deprecations and Removals

    FileSystemExporter but the master table is now core_exporter. This will require that plugins drop
    and recreate their filesystem exporter tables.

    `DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES`.
    [#5949](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/5949)
-   Importing from <file:///> now requires the configuration of the `ALLOWED_IMPORT_PATHS` setting.
    Without this configuration, Pulp will not import content from `file:///` locations correctly.

-   Added an optional parameter base_version to RepositoryVersion add() and removed() methods.
    [#5706](https://pulp.plan.io/issues/5706)

#### Deprecations and Removals

-   Saving an Artifact from a source that is outside of settings.MEDIA_ROOT will copy the file instead
    of moving the file as it did in previous versions. This causes data imported from <file:///> sources
    to be left in tact.
