# Flake8 builtin codes
# --------------------
# E203: no whitespace around ':'. disabled until https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373 is fixed
# W503: This enforces operators before line breaks which is not pep8 or black compatible.
# F824: 'nonlocal' is unused: name is never assigned in scope

# Flake8-quotes extension codes
# -----------------------------
# Q000: double or single quotes only, default is double (don't want to enforce this)
# Q003: Change outer quotes to avoid escaping inner quotes

# Flake8-docstring extension codes
# --------------------------------
# D100: missing docstring in public module
# D104: missing docstring in public package
# D106: missing docstring in public nested class (complains about "class Meta:" and documenting those is silly)
# D200: one-line docstring should fit on one line with quotes
# D205: 1 blank line required between summary line and description
# D400: First line should end with a period
# D401: first line should be imperative (nitpicky)
# D402: first line should not be the function’s “signature” (false positives)
