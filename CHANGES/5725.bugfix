On a request for on-demand content in the content app, a corrupted Remote that
contains the wrong binary (for that content) prevented other Remotes from being
attempted on future requests. Now the last failed Remotes are temporarily ignored
and others may be picked.

Because the [original](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/pull/6064) contains a migraton,
this is backported here as an optional patch which can be enabled by running the
pulpcore-manager command: `backport-patch-6064`.
