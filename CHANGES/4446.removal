Exports now take place in .tar format rather than .tar.gz. It was previously found that the
compression provided little benefit but came with large runtime costs, so the compression
level was reduced to 0. However even packaging the data in a gzip archive without compression
comes with performance costs (particularly on import), so, we remove that layer entirely.
