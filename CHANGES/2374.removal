Removed the Django UI Admin site. It was added to provide RBAC permissions management before there
were APIs that could provide that. It was tech preview and now there are APIs for user and group
management, along with role and permission assignment. It is being removed because the direct DB
access it provides has caused some issues for users, especially since its not integrated with the
validation provided by Django Rest Framework, which Pulp uses.
