Fixed OpenAPI schema tag generation for resources that are nested more than 2 levels.

This change is most evident in client libraries generated from the OpenAPI schema.

Prior to this change, the API client for a resource located at
`/api/v3/pulp/exporters/core/pulp/<uuid>/exports/` was named `ExportersCoreExportsApi`.

After this change, the API client for a resource located at
`/api/v3/pulp/exporters/core/pulp/<uuid>/exports/` is named `ExportersPulpExportsApi`.
