Fixed migration 0064_add_new_style_task_columns to purge extraneous ReservedResource and
TaskReservedResource entries, which could block sync and publish tasks post-upgrade.

Also taught the migration to bulk-update the Task changes. In large installations, this
should have a positive impact on the time it takes to apply the migration.
