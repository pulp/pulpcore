Added ADD_TRAILING_SLASH property to AsyncContentCache. The default value is True. By default,
AsyncContentCache will call into Handler._match_distribution(path, add_trailing_slash=True). If the
meaning of the Distribution's base_path changes when a trailing slash is added, this method will not
match such a Distribution. In this case, AsyncContentCache.ADD_TRAILING_SLASH should be set to
False.
