Using the ViewSet's classname to identify its AccessPolicy has been deprecated and is slated for removal in 3.10.
Instead the urlpattern is supposed to be used.

Plugins with existing AccessPolicies should add a data migration to rename their AccessPolicies:

::
    access_policy = AccessPolicy.get(viewset_name="MyViewSet")
    access_policy.viewset_name = "objectclass/myplugin/myclass"
    access_policy.save()
