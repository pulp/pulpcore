Plugins now have to enable default queryset scoping by setting the ``queryset_scoping`` field on the
AccessPolicy to ``{"function": "scope_queryset"}``.

Default queryset scoping behavior can be changed by supplying a new ``scope_queryset`` method.

Extra queryset scoping functions can be declared on plugin ViewSets and used by setting the
AccessPolicy's ``queryset_scoping`` field.
