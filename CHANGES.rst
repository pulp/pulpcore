===================
REST API
--------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Add support for automatic publishing and distributing.
  `#7626 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7626>`_
- Add a warning at startup time if there are remote artifacts with checksums but no allowed checksums.
  `#7985 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7985>`_
- Added support in content app for properly handling unknown or forbidden digest errors.
  `#7989 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7989>`_
- Added sync check that raises error when only forbidden checksums are found for on-demand content.
  `#8423 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8423>`_
- Added ability for users to delete repo version 0 as long as they still have at least one repo
  version for their repo.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Added asynchronous tasking to the Update and Delete endpoints of PulpExporter to provide proper locking on resources.

- Fixed artifact-stage to handle an edge-case when multiple multi-artifact content, from different remotes, is in a single batch.
  `#8377 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8377>`_
- Fixed Azure artifacts download.
  `#8427 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8427>`_
- Fixed bug during sync where a unique constraint violation for ``Content`` would raise an "X matching
  query does not exist" error.
  `#8430 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8430>`_
- Fix artifact checksum check to not check on-demand content.
  `#8445 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8445>`_

- Distributions are now viewable again at the base url of the content app
  `#8475 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8475>`_
- Fixed a path in artifact_stages that could lead to sync-failures in pulp_container.
  `#8489 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8489>`_


Improved Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Update docs with guide how to change 'ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS' setting using 'pulpcore-manager handle-artifact-checksums --report' if needed.
  `#8325 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8325>`_


Removals
~~~~~~~~

- The Update and Delete endpoints of Exporters changed to now return 202 with tasks.
  `#7438 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7438>`_
- Deprecation warnings are now being logged by default if the log level includes WARNING. This can be
  disabled by adjusting the log level of ``pulpcore.deprecation``. See the deprecation docs for more
  information.
  `#8499 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8499>`_


Misc
~~~~

- `#8450 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8450>`_


Plugin API
----------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Added a new callback method to ``Repository`` named ``on_new_version()``, which runs when a new repository version has been created. This can be used for e.g. automatically publishing or distributing a new repository version after it has been created.
  `#7626 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7626>`_
- Added url as optional argument to ``DigestValidationError`` and ``SizeValidationError`` exceptions to log urls in the exception message.
  `#8357 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8357>`_
- Added the following new objects related to a new ``Distribution`` MasterModel:
  * ``pulpcore.plugin.models.Distribution`` - A new MasterModel ``Distribution`` which replaces the
    ``pulpcore.plugin.models.BaseDistribution``. This now contains the ``repository``,
    ``repository_version``, and ``publication`` fields on the MasterModel instead of on the detail
    models as was done with ``pulpcore.plugin.models.BaseDistribution``.
  * ``pulpcore.plugin.serializer.DistributionSerializer`` - A serializer plugin writers should use
    with the new ``pulpcore.plugin.models.Distribution``.
  * ``pulpcore.plugin.viewset.DistributionViewSet`` - The viewset that replaces the deprecated
    ``pulpcore.plugin.viewset.BaseDistributionViewSet``.
  * ``pulpcore.plugin.viewset.NewDistributionFilter`` - The filter that pairs with the
    ``Distribution`` model.
  `#8384 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8384>`_
- Added checksum type enforcement to ``pulpcore.plugin.download.BaseDownloader``.
  `#8435 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8435>`_
- Adds the ``pulpcore.plugin.tasking.dispatch`` interface which replaces the
  ``pulpcore.plugin.tasking.enqueue_with_reservation`` interface. It is the same except:
  * It returns a ``pulpcore.plugin.models.Task`` instead of an RQ object
  * It does not support the ``options`` keyword argument

  Additionally the ``pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.OperationPostponedResponse`` was updated to support both
  the ``dispatch`` and ``enqueue_with_reservation`` interfaces.
  `#8496 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8496>`_


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Allow plugins to unset the ``queryset_filtering_required_permission`` attribute in ``NamedModelViewSet``.
  `#8438 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8438>`_


Removals
~~~~~~~~

- Removed checksum type filtering from ``pulpcore.plugin.models.Remote.get_downloader`` and ``pulpcore.plugin.stages.DeclarativeArtifact.download``.
  `#8435 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8435>`_


Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The following objects were deprecated:
  * ``pulpcore.plugin.models.BaseDistribution`` -- Instead use
    ``pulpcore.plugin.models.Distribution``.
  * ``pulpcore.plugin.viewset.BaseDistributionViewSet`` -- Instead use
    ``pulpcore.plugin.viewset.DistributionViewSet``.
  * ``pulpcore.plugin.serializer.BaseDistributionSerializer`` -- Instead use
    ``pulpcore.plugin.serializer.DistributionSerializer``.
  * ``pulpcore.plugin.serializer.PublicationDistributionSerializer`` -- Instead use define the
    ``publication`` field directly on your detail distribution object. See the docstring for
    ``pulpcore.plugin.serializer.DistributionSerializer`` for an example.
  * ``pulpcore.plugin.serializer.RepositoryVersionDistributionSerializer`` -- Instead use define the
    ``repository_version`` field directly on your detail distribution object. See the docstring for
    ``pulpcore.plugin.serializer.DistributionSerializer`` for an example.
  * ``pulpcore.plugin.viewset.DistributionFilter`` -- Instead use
    ``pulpcore.plugin.viewset.NewDistributionFilter``.

  .. note::

      You will have to define a migration to move your data from
      ``pulpcore.plugin.models.BaseDistribution`` to ``pulpcore.plugin.models.Distribution``. See the
      pulp_file migration 0009 as a reference example.
  `#8385 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8385>`_
- Deprecated the ``pulpcore.plugin.tasking.enqueue_with_reservation``. Instead use the
  ``pulpcore.plugin.tasking.dispatch`` interface.
  `#8496 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8496>`_
- The usage of non-JSON serializable types of ``args`` and ``kwargs`` to tasks is deprecated. Future
  releases of pulpcore may discontinue accepting complex argument types. Note, UUID objects are not
  JSON serializable. A deprecated warning is logged if a non-JSON serializable is used.
  `#8505 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8505>`_


3.11.0 (2021-03-15)
===================
REST API
--------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Raise error when syncing content with a checksum not included in ``ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS``.
  `#7854 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7854>`_
- User can evaluate how many content units are affected with checksum type change with 'pulpcore-manager handle-artifact-checksums --report'.
  `#7986 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7986>`_
- The fields ``proxy_username`` and ``proxy_password`` have been added to remotes.
  Credentials can no longer be specified as part of the ``proxy_url``.
  A data migration will move the proxy auth information on existing remotes to the new fields.
  `#8167 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8167>`_
- Added the ``WORKER_TTL`` setting, that specifies the interval a worker is considered missing after its last heartbeat.
  `#8291 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8291>`_
- Due to the removal of ``md5`` and ``sha1`` from the ``ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS`` setting, every
  system that had any Artifacts synced in in prior to 3.11 will have to run the ``pulpcore-manager
  handle-content-checksums`` command. A data migration is provided with 3.11 that will run this
  automatically as part of the ``pulpcore-manager migrate`` command all upgrades must run anyway.
  `#8322 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8322>`_


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug experienced by the migration plugin where all content objects are assumed to have a
  remote associated with them.
  `#7876 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7876>`_
- Restored inadvertently-changed content-guards API to its correct endpoint.

  In the process of adding generic list-endpoints, the /pulp/api/v3/contentguards
  API was inadvertently rehomed to /pulp/api/v3/content_guards. This change restores
  it to its published value.
  `#8283 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8283>`_
- Added headers field to the list of fields in the ``RemoteSerializer`` base class and marked it optional to make it accessible via the REST api.
  `#8330 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8330>`_
- Fixed AccessPolicy AttributeError.
  `#8395 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8395>`_


Improved Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Removed correlation id feature from tech preview.
  `#7927 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7927>`_
- Removed 'tech preview' label from ``handle-artifact-checksums`` command.

  ``handle-artifact-checksums`` is now a fully-supported part of Pulp3.
  `#7928 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7928>`_
- Added a warning banner to the ``ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS`` setting section indicating the setting
  is not fully enforcing in ``pulpcore`` code and various plugins.
  `#8342 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8342>`_


Removals
~~~~~~~~

- The ``component`` field of the ``versions`` section of the status API ```/pulp/api/v3/status/`` now
  lists the Django app name, not the Python package name. Similarly the OpenAPI schema at
  ``/pulp/api/v3`` does also.
  `#8198 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8198>`_
- Removed sensitive fields ``username``, ``password``, and ``client_key`` from Remote responses. These
  fields can still be set and updated but will no longer be readable.
  `#8202 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8202>`_
- Adjusted the ``ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS`` setting to remove ``md5`` and ``sha1`` since they are
  insecure. Now, by default, the ``ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS`` contain ``sha224``, ``sha256``,
  ``sha384``, and ``sha512``.
  `#8246 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8246>`_


Misc
~~~~

- `#7797 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7797>`_, `#7984 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7984>`_, `#8315 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8315>`_


Plugin API
----------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Allow developers to use more than one WorkingDirectory() within a task, including nested calls. Tasks will also now use a temporary working directory by default.
  `#7815 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7815>`_
- Added the ``pulpcore.app.pulp_hashlib`` module which provides the ``new`` function and ensures only
  allowed hashers listed in ``ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS`` can be instantiated. Plugin writers should
  use this instead of ``hashlib.new`` to generate checksum hashers.
  `#7984 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7984>`_
- Add a ``get_content`` method to ``pulpcore.plugin.models.RepositoryVersion`` that accepts a
  queryset and returns a list of content in that repository using the given queryset.
  This allows for specific content type to be returned by executing
  ``repo_version.get_content(content_qs=MyContentType.objects)``.
  `#8375 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8375>`_


Improved Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added docs identifying plugin writers to use the ``pulpcore.app.pulp_hashlib`` module which provides
  the ``new`` function and ensures only allowed hashers can be instantiated. This should be used in
  place of ``hashlib.new``.
  `#7984 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7984>`_
- The use of ``tempdir.TemporaryDirectory`` in tasks has been documented.
  `#8231 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8231>`_


Removals
~~~~~~~~

- Adjusted the ``ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS`` setting to remove ``md5`` and ``sha1`` since they are
  insecure. Now, by default, the ``ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS`` contain ``sha224``, ``sha256``,
  ``sha384``, and ``sha512``.
  `#8246 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8246>`_
- Removed unused `get_plugin_storage_path` method.
  `#8343 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8343>`_
- It is not longer possible to address AccessPolicy via the viewset's classname. Viewset's urlpattern should be used instead.
  `#8397 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8397>`_
- Removed deprecated `key` field returned by the signing service.
  Plugin writers must now refer directly to the `public_key` field on the signing service object.
  `#8398 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8398>`_


Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``pulpcore.plugin.tasking.WorkingDirectory`` has been deprecated.
  `#8231 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8231>`_


3.10.0 (2021-02-04)
===================
REST API
--------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Change the default deployment layout

  This changes the default deployment layout. The main change is that MEDIA_ROOT gets its own
  directory. This allows limiting the file permissions in a shared Pulp 2 + Pulp 3 deployment and the
  SELinux file contexts. Another benefit is compatibility with django_extensions' unreferenced_files
  command which lists all files in MEDIA_ROOT that are not in the database.

  Other paths are kept on the same absolute paths. The documentation is updated to show the latest
  best practices.
  `#7178 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7178>`_
- Added general endpoints to list ``Content``, ``ContentGuards``, and ``Repositories``.
  `#7204 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7204>`_
- Added /importers/core/pulp/import-check/ to validate import-parameters.
  `#7549 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7549>`_
- Added a new field called public_key to SigningService. This field preserves the value of the public
  key. In addition to that, the field fingerprint was introduced as well. This field identifies the
  public key.
  `#7700 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7700>`_
- Added possibility to filter users and groups by various fields.
  `#7975 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7975>`_
- Added pulp_labels to allow users to add key/value data to objects.
  `#8065 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8065>`_
- Added ``pulp_label_select`` filter to allow users to filter by labels.
  `#8067 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8067>`_
- Added optional headers field to the aiohttp ClientSession.
  `#8083 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8083>`_
- Allow querying names on the api using name__icontains, name__contains and name__startswith query parameters.
  `#8094 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8094>`_
- Added RBAC to the endpoint for managing groups.
  `#8159 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8159>`_
- Added RBAC to the endpoint for managing group users.
  `#8160 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8160>`_
- Added the ``AccessPolicy.customized`` field which if ``True`` indicates a user has modified the
  default AccessPolicy.
  `#8182 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8182>`_
- Added filtering for access policies.
  `#8189 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8189>`_
- As an authenticated user I can create and view artifacts.
  `#8193 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8193>`_


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed bug where duplicate artifact error message was nondeterministic in displaying different error
  messages with different checksum types. Also, updated duplicate artifact error message to be more
  descriptive.
  `#3387 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/3387>`_
- Fixed Pulp import/export bug that occurs when sha384 or sha512 is not in ``ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS``.
  `#7836 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7836>`_
- X-CSRFToken is not sent through ajax requests (PUT) in api.html. Fixed by setting the right value in
  the JS code.
  `#7888 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7888>`_
- Provide a mechanism to automatically resolve issues and prevent deadlocks when Redis experiences data loss (such as a restart).
  `#7912 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7912>`_
- Silence unnecessary log messages from django_guid which were spamming up the logs.
  `#7982 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7982>`_
- Changed the default permission class to ``IsAdminUser`` to protect endpoints not yet guarded by an access policy from users without permission.
  `#8018 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8018>`_
- Fixed apidoc bug, where model and object permissions on groups overlapped.
  `#8033 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8033>`_
- Fixed the viewset_name used by access policy for the cases when parent_viewset is involved.
  `#8152 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8152>`_
- Made the viewset_name property of access policies read only.
  `#8185 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8185>`_


Improved Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a description of the common filesystem layout in the deployment section.
  `#7750 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7750>`_
- Updated the reference to the new location of pulplift at the installer repository in the development section.
  `#7878 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7878>`_
- Add links to plugin docs into docs.pulpproject.org.
  `#8131 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8131>`_
- Added documentation for labels.
  `#8157 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8157>`_


Misc
~~~~

- `#8203 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8203>`_


Plugin API
----------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Add ``rate_limit`` option to ``Remote``
  `#7965 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7965>`_
- Made DistributionFilter accessible to plugin writers.
  `#8059 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8059>`_
- Adding ``Label`` and ``LabelSerializer`` to the plugin api.
  `#8065 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8065>`_
- Added ``LabelSelectFilter`` to filter resources by labels.
  `#8067 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8067>`_
- Added ReadOnlyRepositoryViewset to the plugin API.
  `#8103 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8103>`_
- Added NAME_FILTER_OPTIONS to the plugin API to gain more consistency across plugins when filter by name or similar CharFields.
  `#8117 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8117>`_
- Added `has_repo_attr_obj_perms` and `has_repo_attr_model_or_obj_perms` to the global access checks available to all plugins to use.
  `#8161 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8161>`_


Removals
~~~~~~~~

- Plugins are required to define a ``version`` attribute on their subclass of
  ``PulpPluginAppConfig``. Starting with pulpcore==3.10, if undefined while Pulp loads, Pulp will
  refuse to start.
  `#7930 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7930>`_
- Changed the default permission class to from ``IsAuthenticated`` to ``IsAdminUser``.
  Any endpoints that should be accessible by all known to the system users need to specify the permission_classes accordingly.
  `#8018 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8018>`_
- ``pulpcore.plugin.models.UnsupportedDigestValidationError`` has been removed. Plugins should
  look for this at ``pulpcore.plugin.exceptions.UnsupportedDigestValidationError`` instead.
  `#8169 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8169>`_


Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Access to the path of the public key of a signing service was deprecated. The value of the public
  key is now expected to be saved in the model instance as ``SigningService.public_key``.
  `#7700 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7700>`_
- The ``pulpcore.plugin.storage.get_plugin_storage_path()`` method has been deprecated.
  `#7935 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7935>`_


3.9.1 (2021-01-21)
==================
REST API
--------

Removals
~~~~~~~~

- CHUNKED_UPLOAD_DIR was converted to a relative path inside MEDIA_ROOT.
  `#8099 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8099>`_

Plugin API
----------

No significant changes.


3.9.0 (2020-12-07)
==================
REST API
--------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Made uploaded chunks to be stored as separate files in the default storage. This feature removes
  the need for a share storage of pulp api nodes, as the chunks are now stored individually in the
  shared storage and are therefore accessible by all nodes.
  `#4498 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/4498>`_
- Add support for logging messages with a correlation id that can either be autogenerated or passed in
  with a ``Correlation-ID`` header. This feature is provided as a tech preview in pulpcore 3.9.
  `#4689 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/4689>`_
- Added progress reporting for pulp imports.
  `#6559 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/6559>`_
- Exposed ``aiohttp.ClientTimeout`` fields in ``Remote`` as ``connect_timeout``,
  ``sock_connect_timeout``, ``sock_read_timeout``, and ``total_timeout``.

  This replaces the previous hard-coded 600 second timeout for sock_connect and sock_read,
  giving per-``Remote`` control of all four ``ClientTimeout`` fields to the user.
  `#7201 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7201>`_
- Enabled users to add checksums to ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS by allowing them to populate checksums
  with handle-artifact-checksums command.
  `#7561 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7561>`_
- Added version information to api docs.
  `#7569 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7569>`_
- Made signing services to be immutable. This requires content signers to create a new signing
  service explicitly when a change occurs.
  `#7701 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7701>`_
- Added support for repairing Pulp by detecting and redownloading missing or corrupted artifact files. Sending a POST request to ``/pulp/api/v3/repair/`` will trigger a task that scans all artifacts for missing and corrupted files in Pulp storage, and will attempt to redownload them from the original remote. Specifying ``verify_checksums=False`` when POSTing to the same endpoint will skip checking the hashes of the files (corruption detection) and will instead just look for missing files.

  The ``verify_checksums`` POST parameter was added to the existing "repository version repair" endpoint as well.
  `#7755 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7755>`_
- Added check to prevent Pulp to start if there are Artifacts with forbidden checksums.
  `#7914 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7914>`_


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a serious bug data integrity bug where some Artifact files could be silently deleted from storage in specific circumstances.
  `#7676 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7676>`_
- Moved the initial creation of access_policies to post_migrate signal.
  This enforces their existance both with migrate and flush.
  `#7710 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7710>`_
- Fixed incremental export to happen if start_version provided, even if last_export is null.
  `#7716 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7716>`_
- Fixed a file descriptor leak during repository version repair operations.
  `#7735 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7735>`_
- Fixed bug where exporter directory existed and was writable but not owned by worker process and thus
  not chmod-able.
  `#7829 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7829>`_
- Properly namespaced the `viewset_name` in `AccessPolicy` to avoid naming conflicts in plugins.
  `#7845 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7845>`_
- Update jquery version from 3.3.1 to 3.5.1 in API.html template. It is the version provided by djangorestframework~=3.12.2
  `#7850 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7850>`_
- Prevented a Redis failure scenario from causing the tasking system to back up due to "tasking system
  locks" not being released, even on worker restart.
  `#7907 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7907>`_
- Use subclassed plugin downloaders during the pulp repair.
  `#7909 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7909>`_


Improved Documentation

  `#7908 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7908>`_


Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Plugins are encouraged to define a ``version`` attribute on their subclass of
  ``PulpPluginAppConfig``. If undefined while Pulp loads a warning is now shown to encourage plugin
  writers to implement this attribute, which will be required starting in pulpcore==3.10.
  `#6671 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/6671>`_
- Using the ViewSet's classname to identify its AccessPolicy has been deprecated and is slated for removal in 3.10.
  Instead the urlpattern is supposed to be used.

  Plugins with existing AccessPolicies should add a data migration to rename their AccessPolicies:

  ::
      access_policy = AccessPolicy.get(viewset_name="MyViewSet")
      access_policy.viewset_name = "objectclass/myplugin/myclass"
      access_policy.save()
  `#7845 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7845>`_
- The ``pulpcore.plugin.models.UnsupportedDigestValidationError`` is being deprecated and
  will be removed in 3.10.

  It can now be found at ``pulpcore.plugin.exceptions.UnsupportedDigestValidationError``
  instead; please change any code that imports it to access it from its new location.

- A new `pulpcore.plugin.models.AutoDeleteObjPermsMixin` object can be added to models to
  automatically delete all user and group permissions for an object just before the object is deleted.
  This provides an easy cleanup mechanism and can be added to models as a mixin. Note that your model
  must support `django-lifecycle` to use this mixin.
  `#7157 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7157>`_
- A new model `pulpcore.plugin.models.AccessPolicy` is available to store AccessPolicy statements in
  the database. The model's `statements` field stores the list of policy statements as a JSON field.
  The `name` field stores the name of the Viewset the `AccessPolicy` is protecting.

  Additionally, the `pulpcore.plugin.access_policy.AccessPolicyFromDB` is a drf-access-policy which
  viewsets can use to protect their viewsets with. See the :ref:`viewset_enforcement` for more
  information on this.

- A new `pulpcore.plugin.models.AutoAddObjPermsMixin` object can be added to models to automatically
  add permissions for an object just after the object is created. This is controlled by data saved in
  the `permissions_assignment` attribute of the `pulpcore.plugin.models.AccessPolicy` allowing users
  to control what permissions are created. Note that your model must support `django-lifecycle` to use
  this mixin.
  `#7210 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7210>`_
- Added ability for plugin writers to set a ``content_mapping`` property on content resources to
  provide a custom mapping of content to repositories.
  `#7252 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7252>`_
- Automatically excluding ``pulp_id``, ``pulp_created``, and ``pulp_last_updated`` for
  ``QueryModelResources``.
  `#7277 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7277>`_
- Viewsets that subclass ``pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.NamedModelViewSet` can declare the
  ``queryset_filtering_required_permission`` class attribute naming the permission required to view
  an object. See the :ref:`queryset_scoping` documentation for more information.
  `#7300 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7300>`_

  `#5706 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/5706>`_


Deprecations and Removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Saving an Artifact from a source that is outside of settings.MEDIA_ROOT will copy the file instead
  of moving the file as it did in previous versions. This causes data imported from file:/// sources
  to be left in tact.

3.0.0 (2019-12-11)
==================

.. note::

    Task names, e.g. ``pulpcore.app.tasks.orphan.orphan_cleanup``, are subject to change in future
    releases 3.y releases. These are represented in the Task API as the "name" attribute. Please
    check future release notes to see when these names will be considered stable. Otherwise, the
    REST API pulpcore provides is considered semantically versioned.
