3.17.1 (2021-12-21)
===================
REST API
--------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed migration 0081 to be compatible with custom User models.
  `#9654 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9654>`_


Plugin API
----------

No significant changes.


3.17.0 (2021-12-14)
===================
REST API
--------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Added a ``/tasks/purge/`` API to do bulk-deletion of old tasks.

  Over time, the database can fill with task-records. This API allows
  an installation to bulk-remove records based on their completion
  timestamps.

  NOTE: this endpoint is in tech-preview and may change in backwards
  incompatible ways in the future.
  `#8554 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8554>`_
- Added a role model to support RBAC and the utility functions ``assign_role`` and ``remove_role``.

  The field ``permissions_assignment`` of access policies has been renamed to ``creation_hooks``. A
  compatibility patch has been added to be removed with pulpcore=3.20.

  The ``permissions`` argument to ``creation_hooks`` has been deprecated to be removed with
  pulpcore=3.20.
  `#9411 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9411>`_
- Added views to assign model and object level roles to users and groups.
  `#9413 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9413>`_
- Rewrote existing access policies on viewsets to use roles.
  `#9415 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9415>`_
- Added validation to prevent credentials in remote urls. Also added data migration to move
  credentials out of remote url and into remote username/password fields for existing remotes.
  `#9459 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9459>`_
- Reworked RBAC Content Guards to now use roles. Added new endpoints ``{list, add, remove}_roles`` and ``my_permissions`` to the RBAC content guard viewset.
  `#9498 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9498>`_
- Content-type and Content-disposition headers are now sent in the AzureStorage.url.
  `#9518 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9518>`_
- SigningService scripts can now access the public key fingerprint using the ``PULP_SIGNING_KEY_FINGERPRINT`` environment variable.
  This allows for more generic scripts, that do not need to "guess" (hardcode) what key they should use.
  `#9532 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9532>`_
- Added object specific endpoints ``{list,add}_roles``, ``remove_roles`` and ``my_permissions`` to tasks and groups viewsets.
  `#9604 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9604>`_
- Added a ``reset`` endpoint to the access policy viewset to revert to the provided default uncustomized access policy.
  `#9606 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9606>`_


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- PulpImporter now unpacks into the task-worker's working directory rather than /tmp. Unpacking
  large files into /tmp could cause the operation to fail, or even cause stability issues for
  Pulp instance, due to running /tmp out of space.
  `#8610 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8610>`_
- Missing worker records are now kept in the database for seven days allowing time for post-mortem
  analysis of them. The user-facing data in the status API remains unmodified.
  `#8988 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8988>`_
- Made Pulp to be fault-tolerant to Redis server connection issues.
  `#8997 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8997>`_
- Cache is now properly invalidated after reclaim disk task.
  `#9215 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9215>`_
- Fixed bug where the content app would stop working after a brief loss of connection to the database.
  `#9276 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9276>`_
- Improved messaging around timeout requests.
  `#9301 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9301>`_
- Updated the distribution validation to properly handle the use of ``repository`` / ``repository_version`` / ``publication``.
  `#9434 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9434>`_
- Fixed issue with listing repository versions while running orphan cleanup task.
  `#9481 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9481>`_
- Fixed erroneous ordering filters from appearing in HTML views and causing 500 errors when used.
  `#9496 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9496>`_

  `#9542 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9542>`_
- Fixed a bug in pulpcore-worker, where wakeup and cancel signals could be lost due to a race
  condition.
  `#9549 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9549>`_
- Fixed bug where chunked uploads were being assembled in /tmp.
  `#9550 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9550>`_
- Created a proxy model for Groups to allow using creation_hooks with them.
  `#9588 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9588>`_
- Fixed permission errors on artifact retrieval from object storage when redis caching is enabled.
  `#9595 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9595>`_

- Fixed the path to uploaded artifacts.
  `#9527 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9527>`_


Removals
~~~~~~~~

- The ``pulpcore-worker`` binary no longer accepts the ``--resource-manager`` flag. There is no
  resource manager anymore, so this flag is no longer needed.
  `#9327 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9327>`_
- Removed tech previewed ``assign_permission`` and ``remove_permission`` endpoints from RBAC content guard viewset.
  `#9498 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9498>`_


Misc
~~~~

- `#9353 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9353>`_, `#9354 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9354>`_, `#9506 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9506>`_


Plugin API
----------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Added ``get_objects_for_user`` to support queryset filtering by roles. 
  Added hooks in ``AutoAddObjPermsMixin`` to support auto-assignment of roles.

  Changed the lookup for creation hooks so hooks need to be registered in
  ``REGISTERED_CREATION_HOOKS`` on the model to be used. The signature for creation hooks that are
  registered must match the exploded version of the dict parameters from the access policy.
  Unregistered creation hooks are deprecated and support will be dropped in pulpcore 3.20.

  `#8870 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8870>`_
- The settings file switched ``DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES`` to use ``AccessPolicyFromDB`` instead of
  ``IsAdminUser`` with a fallback to a behavior of ``IsAdminUser``. With this feature plugin writers
  no longer need to declare ``permission_classes`` on their Views or Viewsets to use
  ``AccessPolicyFromDB``.
  `#8974 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8974>`_
- Upgraded django from 2.2 to 3.2.
  `#9018 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9018>`_
- `pulpcore.plugin.models.ProgressReport` now has async interfaces: asave(), aincrease_by(),
  aincrement(), __aenter__(), _aexit__(). Plugins should switch to the async interfaces in their
  Stages.
  `pulpcore.plugin.sync.sync_to_async_iterator` is a utility method to synchronize the database
  queries generated when a QuerySet is iterated.
  `#9129 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9129>`_
- Added ``shared_resources`` to the ``dispatch`` call, so tasks can run concurrently if they need overlapping resources for read only.
  `#9148 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9148>`_
- Added ``touch`` to Artifact and Content query sets for bulk operation.
  `#9234 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9234>`_
- Added `ContentManager` to the plugin API - all subclasses of `Content` that add their own custom manager should have the manager subclass `ContentManager`.
  `#9269 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9269>`_


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Added kwarg to RemoteArtifactSaver init to allow enabling handling of rare error edge-case.

  `fix_mismatched_remote_artifacts=True` enables workaround for a failure-scenario that
  (so far) is only encountered by pulp_rpm. Current behavior is the default.
  `#8133 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8133>`_


Removals
~~~~~~~~

- Removed the ``pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.NewDistributionFilter``. Instead use
  ``pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.DistributionFilter``.
  `#8479 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8479>`_
- Removed ``FilesystemExporterSerializer`` and ``PublicationExportSerializer`` from the plugin api.
  Filesystem exports are now handled by pulpcore.
  `#8860 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8860>`_
- The ``pulpcore.plugin.download.http_giveup`` method has been removed from the plugin API. Plugins
  used to have to use this to wrap the ``_run`` method defined on subclasses of ``HttpDownloader``,
  but starting with pulpcore 3.14 the backoff is implemented directly in the ``HttpDownloader.run()``
  method which subclasses do not override. Due to ``pulpcore`` implementing it, it is no longer needed
  or available for plugins to use.
  `#8913 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8913>`_


Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ContentSaver._pre_save() and ContentSaver._post_save() hooks are no longer coroutines. They should
  be implemented as synchronous functions.
  `#9129 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9129>`_
- Deprecate the compatibility layer for access policies. As of pulpcore 3.16, all plugins should
  properly use the "condition" and "condition_expression" fields in the access policy statements.
  `#9160 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/9160>`_
- Deprecate the ``resources`` argument of ``dispatch`` in favor of ``exclusive_resources`` and ``shared_resources``.

3.14.0 (2021-07-01)
===================
REST API
--------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Introduce new worker style. (tech-preview)
  `#8501 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8501>`_
- Added new endpoint ``/pulp/api/v3/orphans/cleanup/``. When called with ``POST`` and no parameters
  it is equivalent to calling ``DELETE /pulp/api/v3/orphans/``. Additionally the optional parameter
  ``content_hrefs`` can be specified and must contain a list of content hrefs. When ``content_hrefs``
  is specified, only those content units will be considered to be removed by orphan cleanup.
  `#8658 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8658>`_
- Content app responses are now smartly cached in Redis.
  `#8805 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8805>`_
- Downloads from remote sources will now be retried on more kinds of errors, such as HTTP 500 or socket errors.
  `#8881 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8881>`_
- Add a correlation id filter to the task list endpoint.
  `#8891 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8891>`_
- Where before ``download_concurrency`` would previously be set to a default value upon creation, it will now be set NULL (but a default value will still be used).

- Added graceful shutdown to pulpcore workers.
  `#8930 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8930>`_
- Activate the new task worker type by default.

  .. warning::

     If you intend to stick with the old tasking system, you should configure the
     ``USE_NEW_WORKER_TYPE`` setting to false before upgrade

  `#8948 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8948>`_


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed race condition where a task could clean up reserved resources shared with another task.
  `#8637 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8637>`_
- Altered redirect URL escaping, preventing invalidation of signed URLs for artifacts using cloud storage.
  `#8670 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8670>`_
- Add an update row lock on in task dispatching for ``ReservedResource`` to prevent a race where an
  object was deleted that was supposed to be reused. This prevents a condition where tasks ended up in
  waiting state forever.
  `#8708 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8708>`_
- Retry downloads on ``ClientConnectorSSLError``, which appears to be spuriously returned by some CDNs.
  `#8867 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8867>`_
- Fixed OpenAPI schema tag generation for resources that are nested more than 2 levels.

  This change is most evident in client libraries generated from the OpenAPI schema.

  Prior to this change, the API client for a resource located at
  `/api/v3/pulp/exporters/core/pulp/<uuid>/exports/` was named `ExportersCoreExportsApi`.

  After this change, the API client for a resource located at
  `/api/v3/pulp/exporters/core/pulp/<uuid>/exports/` is named `ExportersPulpExportsApi`.
  `#8868 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8868>`_
- Fixed request schema for ``/pulp/api/v3/repair/``, which did identify any arguments. This also fixes
  the bindings.
  `#8869 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8869>`_
- Update default access policies in the database if they were unmodified by the administrator.
  `#8883 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8883>`_
- Pinning to psycopg2 < 2.9 as psycopg 2.9 doesn't work with django 2.2. More info at
  https://github.com/django/django/commit/837ffcfa681d0f65f444d881ee3d69aec23770be.
  `#8926 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8926>`_
- Fixed bug where artifacts and content were not always saved in Pulp with each
  on_demand request serviced by content app.
  `#8980 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8980>`_


Improved Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a number of link-problems in the installation/ section of docs.
  `#6837 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/6837>`_
- Added a troubleshooting section to the docs explaining how to find stuck tasks.
  `#8774 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8774>`_
- Moved existing basic auth docs to a new top-level section named Authentication.
  `#8800 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8800>`_
- Moved ``Webserver Authentication`` docs under the top-level ``Authentication`` section.
  `#8801 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8801>`_
- Provide instructions to use Keycloak authenication using Python Social Aauth
  `#8803 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8803>`_
- Updated the docs.pulpproject.org to provide some immediate direction for better user orientation.
  `#8946 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8946>`_
- Separated hardware and Filesystem information from the Architecture section and added them to the Installation section.
  `#8947 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8947>`_
- Added sub-headings and simplified language of Pulp concept section.
  `#8949 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8949>`_

Plugin API
----------

Features
~~~~~~~~

  ``pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.NewDistributionFilter``.
  `#8480 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8480>`_
- Added ``user_hidden`` field to ``Repository`` to hide repositories from users.
  `#8487 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8487>`_
- Added a ``timestamp_of_interest`` field to Content and Artifacts. This field can be updated by
  calling a new method ``touch()`` on Artifacts and Content. Plugin writers should call this method
  whenever they deal with Content or Artifacts. For example, this includes places where Content is
  uploaded or added to Repository Versions. This will prevent Content and Artifacts from being cleaned
  up when orphan cleanup becomes a non-blocking task in pulpcore 3.15.
  `#8823 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8823>`_
- Exposed ``AsyncUpdateMixin`` through ``pulpcore.plugin.viewsets``.
  `#8844 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8844>`_
- Added a field ``DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES`` to the ``Remote`` base class - plugin writers can override the default number of retries attempted when file downloads failed for each type of remote. The default value is 3.
  `#8881 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8881>`_
- Added a field ``DEFAULT_DOWNLOAD_CONCURRENCY`` to the Remote base class - plugin writers can override the number of concurrent downloads for each type of remote. The default value is 10.
  `#8897 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8897>`_


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed OpenAPI schema tag generation for resources that are nested more than 2 levels.

  This change is most evident in client libraries generated from the OpenAPI schema.

  Prior to this change, the API client for a resource located at
  `/api/v3/pulp/exporters/core/pulp/<uuid>/exports/` was named `ExportersCoreExportsApi`.

  `#8868 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8868>`_


Removals
~~~~~~~~

- The usage of non-JSON serializable types of ``args`` and ``kwargs`` to tasks is no longer supported.
  ``uuid.UUID`` objects however will silently be converted to ``str``.
  `#8501 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8501>`_
- Removed the ``versions_containing_content`` method from the
  `pulpcore.plugin.models.RepositoryVersion`` object. Instead use
  ``RepositoryVersion.objects.with_content()``.
  `#8729 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8729>`_
- Removed `pulpcore.plugin.stages.ContentUnassociation` from the plugin API.
  `#8827 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8827>`_


Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.NewDistributionFilter`` is deprecated and will be removed from a
  future release. Instead use ``pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.DistributionFilter``.
  `#8480 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8480>`_
- Deprecate the use of the `reserved_resources_record__resource` in favor of `reserved_resources_record__contains`.
  Tentative removal release is pulpcore==3.15.
  `#8501 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8501>`_
- Plugin writers who create custom downloaders by subclassing ``HttpDownloader`` no longer need to wrap the ``_run()`` method with a ``backoff`` decorator. Consequntly the ``http_giveup`` handler the sake of the ``backoff`` decorator is no longer needed and has been deprecated. It is likely to be removed in pulpcore 3.15.
  `#8881 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8881>`_

- Fixed a scenario where canceled tasks could be marked failed.
  `#7980 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7980>`_
- Taught ``PulpImport`` correct way to find and import ``RepositoryVersions``. Previous
  implementation only worked for ``RepositoryVersions`` that were the 'current' version
  of the exported ``Repository``.

- Fixed a race condition that sometimes surfaced during handling of reserved resources.
  `#8352 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8352>`_

  `#7438 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7438>`_
- Deprecation warnings are now being logged by default if the log level includes WARNING. This can be
  disabled by adjusting the log level of ``pulpcore.deprecation``. See the deprecation docs for more
  information.
  `#8499 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8499>`_


Misc
~~~~

- `#8450 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8450>`_


Plugin API
----------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Added a new callback method to ``Repository`` named ``on_new_version()``, which runs when a new repository version has been created. This can be used for e.g. automatically publishing or distributing a new repository version after it has been created.
  `#7626 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7626>`_
- Added url as optional argument to ``DigestValidationError`` and ``SizeValidationError`` exceptions to log urls in the exception message.
  `#8357 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8357>`_
- Added the following new objects related to a new ``Distribution`` MasterModel:
  * ``pulpcore.plugin.models.Distribution`` - A new MasterModel ``Distribution`` which replaces the
  ``pulpcore.plugin.models.BaseDistribution``. This now contains the ``repository``,
  ``repository_version``, and ``publication`` fields on the MasterModel instead of on the detail
  models as was done with ``pulpcore.plugin.models.BaseDistribution``.
  * ``pulpcore.plugin.serializer.DistributionSerializer`` - A serializer plugin writers should use
  with the new ``pulpcore.plugin.models.Distribution``.
  * ``pulpcore.plugin.viewset.DistributionViewSet`` - The viewset that replaces the deprecated
  ``pulpcore.plugin.viewset.BaseDistributionViewSet``.
  * ``pulpcore.plugin.viewset.NewDistributionFilter`` - The filter that pairs with the
  ``Distribution`` model.
  `#8384 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8384>`_
- Added checksum type enforcement to ``pulpcore.plugin.download.BaseDownloader``.
  `#8435 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8435>`_
- Adds the ``pulpcore.plugin.tasking.dispatch`` interface which replaces the
  ``pulpcore.plugin.tasking.enqueue_with_reservation`` interface. It is the same except:
  * It returns a ``pulpcore.plugin.models.Task`` instead of an RQ object
  * It does not support the ``options`` keyword argument

  Additionally the ``pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.OperationPostponedResponse`` was updated to support both
  the ``dispatch`` and ``enqueue_with_reservation`` interfaces.
  `#8496 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8496>`_


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Allow plugins to unset the ``queryset_filtering_required_permission`` attribute in ``NamedModelViewSet``.
  `#8438 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8438>`_


Removals
~~~~~~~~

- Removed checksum type filtering from ``pulpcore.plugin.models.Remote.get_downloader`` and ``pulpcore.plugin.stages.DeclarativeArtifact.download``.
  `#8435 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8435>`_


Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The following objects were deprecated:
  * ``pulpcore.plugin.models.BaseDistribution`` -- Instead use
  ``pulpcore.plugin.models.Distribution``.
  * ``pulpcore.plugin.viewset.BaseDistributionViewSet`` -- Instead use
  ``pulpcore.plugin.viewset.DistributionViewSet``.
  * ``pulpcore.plugin.serializer.BaseDistributionSerializer`` -- Instead use
  ``pulpcore.plugin.serializer.DistributionSerializer``.
  * ``pulpcore.plugin.serializer.PublicationDistributionSerializer`` -- Instead use define the
  ``publication`` field directly on your detail distribution object. See the docstring for
  ``pulpcore.plugin.serializer.DistributionSerializer`` for an example.
  * ``pulpcore.plugin.serializer.RepositoryVersionDistributionSerializer`` -- Instead use define the
  ``repository_version`` field directly on your detail distribution object. See the docstring for
  ``pulpcore.plugin.serializer.DistributionSerializer`` for an example.
  * ``pulpcore.plugin.viewset.DistributionFilter`` -- Instead use
  ``pulpcore.plugin.viewset.NewDistributionFilter``.

  .. note::

      You will have to define a migration to move your data from
      ``pulpcore.plugin.models.BaseDistribution`` to ``pulpcore.plugin.models.Distribution``. See the
      pulp_file migration 0009 as a reference example.

  `#8385 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8385>`_
- Deprecated the ``pulpcore.plugin.tasking.enqueue_with_reservation``. Instead use the
  ``pulpcore.plugin.tasking.dispatch`` interface.
  `#8496 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8496>`_
- The usage of non-JSON serializable types of ``args`` and ``kwargs`` to tasks is deprecated. Future
  releases of pulpcore may discontinue accepting complex argument types. Note, UUID objects are not
  JSON serializable. A deprecated warning is logged if a non-JSON serializable is used.
  `#8505 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8505>`_


3.11.2 (2021-05-25)
===================
REST API
--------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Skip allowed content checks on collectstatic
  (backported from #8711)
  `#8712 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8712>`_
- Fixed cleanup of UploadChunks when their corresponding Upload is deleted.
  (backported from #7316)
  `#8757 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8757>`_
- Fixed compatibility with Django 2.2 LTS. Pulp now requires Django~=2.2.23
  (backported from #8691)
  `#8758 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8758>`_
- Pinned click~=7.1.2 to ensure RQ is compatible with it.
  `#8767 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8767>`_


Plugin API
----------

No significant changes.


3.11.1 (2021-04-29)
===================
REST API
--------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a race condition that sometimes surfaced during handling of reserved resources.
  `#8632 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8632>`_
- Handled a tasking race condition where cleaning up resource reservations sometimes raised an IntegrityError.
  `#8648 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8648>`_


Plugin API
----------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Allow plugins to unset the ``queryset_filtering_required_permission`` attribute in ``NamedModelViewSet``.
  `#8444 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8444>`_


3.11.0 (2021-03-15)
===================
REST API
--------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Raise error when syncing content with a checksum not included in ``ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS``.
  `#7854 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7854>`_
- User can evaluate how many content units are affected with checksum type change with 'pulpcore-manager handle-artifact-checksums --report'.
  `#7986 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7986>`_
- The fields ``proxy_username`` and ``proxy_password`` have been added to remotes.
  Credentials can no longer be specified as part of the ``proxy_url``.
  A data migration will move the proxy auth information on existing remotes to the new fields.
  `#8167 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8167>`_
- Added the ``WORKER_TTL`` setting, that specifies the interval a worker is considered missing after its last heartbeat.
  `#8291 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8291>`_
- Due to the removal of ``md5`` and ``sha1`` from the ``ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS`` setting, every
  system that had any Artifacts synced in in prior to 3.11 will have to run the ``pulpcore-manager
  handle-content-checksums`` command. A data migration is provided with 3.11 that will run this
  automatically as part of the ``pulpcore-manager migrate`` command all upgrades must run anyway.
  `#8322 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8322>`_


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug experienced by the migration plugin where all content objects are assumed to have a
  remote associated with them.
  `#7876 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7876>`_
- Restored inadvertently-changed content-guards API to its correct endpoint.

  In the process of adding generic list-endpoints, the /pulp/api/v3/contentguards
  API was inadvertently rehomed to /pulp/api/v3/content_guards. This change restores
  it to its published value.
  `#8283 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8283>`_
- Added headers field to the list of fields in the ``RemoteSerializer`` base class and marked it optional to make it accessible via the REST api.
  `#8330 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8330>`_
- Fixed AccessPolicy AttributeError.
  `#8395 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8395>`_


Improved Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Removed correlation id feature from tech preview.
  `#7927 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7927>`_
- Removed 'tech preview' label from ``handle-artifact-checksums`` command.

  ``handle-artifact-checksums`` is now a fully-supported part of Pulp3.
  `#7928 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7928>`_
- Added a warning banner to the ``ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS`` setting section indicating the setting
  is not fully enforcing in ``pulpcore`` code and various plugins.
  `#8342 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8342>`_


Removals
~~~~~~~~

- The ``component`` field of the ``versions`` section of the status API ```/pulp/api/v3/status/`` now
  lists the Django app name, not the Python package name. Similarly the OpenAPI schema at
  ``/pulp/api/v3`` does also.
  `#8198 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8198>`_
- Removed sensitive fields ``username``, ``password``, and ``client_key`` from Remote responses. These
  fields can still be set and updated but will no longer be readable.
  `#8202 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8202>`_
- Adjusted the ``ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS`` setting to remove ``md5`` and ``sha1`` since they are
  insecure. Now, by default, the ``ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS`` contain ``sha224``, ``sha256``,
  ``sha384``, and ``sha512``.
  `#8246 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8246>`_


Misc
~~~~

- `#7797 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7797>`_, `#7984 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7984>`_, `#8315 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8315>`_


Plugin API
----------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Allow developers to use more than one WorkingDirectory() within a task, including nested calls. Tasks will also now use a temporary working directory by default.
  `#7815 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7815>`_
- Added the ``pulpcore.app.pulp_hashlib`` module which provides the ``new`` function and ensures only
  allowed hashers listed in ``ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS`` can be instantiated. Plugin writers should
  use this instead of ``hashlib.new`` to generate checksum hashers.
  `#7984 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7984>`_
- Add a ``get_content`` method to ``pulpcore.plugin.models.RepositoryVersion`` that accepts a
  queryset and returns a list of content in that repository using the given queryset.
  This allows for specific content type to be returned by executing
  ``repo_version.get_content(content_qs=MyContentType.objects)``.
  `#8375 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8375>`_


Improved Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added docs identifying plugin writers to use the ``pulpcore.app.pulp_hashlib`` module which provides
  the ``new`` function and ensures only allowed hashers can be instantiated. This should be used in
  place of ``hashlib.new``.
  `#7984 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7984>`_
- The use of ``tempdir.TemporaryDirectory`` in tasks has been documented.
  `#8231 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8231>`_


Removals
~~~~~~~~

- Adjusted the ``ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS`` setting to remove ``md5`` and ``sha1`` since they are
  insecure. Now, by default, the ``ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS`` contain ``sha224``, ``sha256``,
  ``sha384``, and ``sha512``.
  `#8246 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8246>`_
- Removed unused `get_plugin_storage_path` method.
  `#8343 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8343>`_
- It is not longer possible to address AccessPolicy via the viewset's classname. Viewset's urlpattern should be used instead.
  `#8397 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8397>`_
- Removed deprecated `key` field returned by the signing service.
  Plugin writers must now refer directly to the `public_key` field on the signing service object.
  `#8398 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8398>`_


Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``pulpcore.plugin.tasking.WorkingDirectory`` has been deprecated.
  `#8231 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8231>`_


3.10.0 (2021-02-04)
===================
REST API
--------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Change the default deployment layout

  This changes the default deployment layout. The main change is that MEDIA_ROOT gets its own
  directory. This allows limiting the file permissions in a shared Pulp 2 + Pulp 3 deployment and the
  SELinux file contexts. Another benefit is compatibility with django_extensions' unreferenced_files
  command which lists all files in MEDIA_ROOT that are not in the database.

  Other paths are kept on the same absolute paths. The documentation is updated to show the latest
  best practices.
  `#7178 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7178>`_
- Added general endpoints to list ``Content``, ``ContentGuards``, and ``Repositories``.
  `#7204 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7204>`_
- Added /importers/core/pulp/import-check/ to validate import-parameters.
  `#7549 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7549>`_
- Added a new field called public_key to SigningService. This field preserves the value of the public
  key. In addition to that, the field fingerprint was introduced as well. This field identifies the
  public key.
  `#7700 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7700>`_
- Added possibility to filter users and groups by various fields.
  `#7975 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7975>`_
- Added pulp_labels to allow users to add key/value data to objects.
  `#8065 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8065>`_
- Added ``pulp_label_select`` filter to allow users to filter by labels.
  `#8067 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8067>`_
- Added optional headers field to the aiohttp ClientSession.
  `#8083 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8083>`_
- Allow querying names on the api using name__icontains, name__contains and name__startswith query parameters.
  `#8094 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8094>`_
- Added RBAC to the endpoint for managing groups.
  `#8159 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8159>`_
- Added RBAC to the endpoint for managing group users.
  `#8160 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8160>`_
- Added the ``AccessPolicy.customized`` field which if ``True`` indicates a user has modified the
  default AccessPolicy.
  `#8182 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8182>`_
- Added filtering for access policies.
  `#8189 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8189>`_
- As an authenticated user I can create and view artifacts.
  `#8193 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8193>`_


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed bug where duplicate artifact error message was nondeterministic in displaying different error
  messages with different checksum types. Also, updated duplicate artifact error message to be more
  descriptive.
  `#3387 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/3387>`_
- Fixed Pulp import/export bug that occurs when sha384 or sha512 is not in ``ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS``.
  `#7836 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7836>`_
- X-CSRFToken is not sent through ajax requests (PUT) in api.html. Fixed by setting the right value in
  the JS code.
  `#7888 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7888>`_
- Provide a mechanism to automatically resolve issues and prevent deadlocks when Redis experiences data loss (such as a restart).
  `#7912 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7912>`_
- Silence unnecessary log messages from django_guid which were spamming up the logs.
  `#7982 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7982>`_
- Changed the default permission class to ``IsAdminUser`` to protect endpoints not yet guarded by an access policy from users without permission.
  `#8018 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8018>`_
- Fixed apidoc bug, where model and object permissions on groups overlapped.
  `#8033 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8033>`_
- Fixed the viewset_name used by access policy for the cases when parent_viewset is involved.
  `#8152 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8152>`_
- Made the viewset_name property of access policies read only.
  `#8185 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8185>`_


Improved Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a description of the common filesystem layout in the deployment section.
  `#7750 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7750>`_
- Updated the reference to the new location of pulplift at the installer repository in the development section.
  `#7878 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7878>`_
- Add links to plugin docs into docs.pulpproject.org.
  `#8131 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8131>`_
- Added documentation for labels.
  `#8157 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8157>`_


Misc
~~~~

- `#8203 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8203>`_


Plugin API
----------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Add ``rate_limit`` option to ``Remote``
  `#7965 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7965>`_
- Made DistributionFilter accessible to plugin writers.
  `#8059 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8059>`_

- Added ReadOnlyRepositoryViewset to the plugin API.
  `#8103 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8103>`_
- Added NAME_FILTER_OPTIONS to the plugin API to gain more consistency across plugins when filter by name or similar CharFields.
  `#8117 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8117>`_
- Added `has_repo_attr_obj_perms` and `has_repo_attr_model_or_obj_perms` to the global access checks available to all plugins to use.
  `#8161 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8161>`_


Removals
~~~~~~~~

- Plugins are required to define a ``version`` attribute on their subclass of
  ``PulpPluginAppConfig``. Starting with pulpcore==3.10, if undefined while Pulp loads, Pulp will
  refuse to start.
  `#7930 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7930>`_
- Changed the default permission class to from ``IsAuthenticated`` to ``IsAdminUser``.
  Any endpoints that should be accessible by all known to the system users need to specify the permission_classes accordingly.
  `#8018 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8018>`_
- ``pulpcore.plugin.models.UnsupportedDigestValidationError`` has been removed. Plugins should
  look for this at ``pulpcore.plugin.exceptions.UnsupportedDigestValidationError`` instead.
  `#8169 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8169>`_


Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Access to the path of the public key of a signing service was deprecated. The value of the public
  key is now expected to be saved in the model instance as ``SigningService.public_key``.
  `#7700 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7700>`_

  `#7935 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7935>`_


3.9.1 (2021-01-21)
==================
REST API
--------

Removals
~~~~~~~~

- CHUNKED_UPLOAD_DIR was converted to a relative path inside MEDIA_ROOT.
  `#8099 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/8099>`_

Plugin API
----------

No significant changes.


3.9.0 (2020-12-07)
==================
REST API
--------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Made uploaded chunks to be stored as separate files in the default storage. This feature removes
  the need for a share storage of pulp api nodes, as the chunks are now stored individually in the
  shared storage and are therefore accessible by all nodes.
  `#4498 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/4498>`_
- Add support for logging messages with a correlation id that can either be autogenerated or passed in
  with a ``Correlation-ID`` header. This feature is provided as a tech preview in pulpcore 3.9.
  `#4689 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/4689>`_
- Added progress reporting for pulp imports.
  `#6559 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/6559>`_
- Exposed ``aiohttp.ClientTimeout`` fields in ``Remote`` as ``connect_timeout``,
  ``sock_connect_timeout``, ``sock_read_timeout``, and ``total_timeout``.

  This replaces the previous hard-coded 600 second timeout for sock_connect and sock_read,
  giving per-``Remote`` control of all four ``ClientTimeout`` fields to the user.
  `#7201 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7201>`_
- Enabled users to add checksums to ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS by allowing them to populate checksums
  with handle-artifact-checksums command.
  `#7561 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7561>`_
- Added version information to api docs.
  `#7569 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7569>`_
- Made signing services to be immutable. This requires content signers to create a new signing
  service explicitly when a change occurs.
  `#7701 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7701>`_
- Added support for repairing Pulp by detecting and redownloading missing or corrupted artifact files. Sending a POST request to ``/pulp/api/v3/repair/`` will trigger a task that scans all artifacts for missing and corrupted files in Pulp storage, and will attempt to redownload them from the original remote. Specifying ``verify_checksums=False`` when POSTing to the same endpoint will skip checking the hashes of the files (corruption detection) and will instead just look for missing files.

  The ``verify_checksums`` POST parameter was added to the existing "repository version repair" endpoint as well.
  `#7755 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7755>`_
- Added check to prevent Pulp to start if there are Artifacts with forbidden checksums.
  `#7914 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7914>`_


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a serious bug data integrity bug where some Artifact files could be silently deleted from storage in specific circumstances.
  `#7676 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7676>`_
- Moved the initial creation of access_policies to post_migrate signal.
  This enforces their existance both with migrate and flush.
  `#7710 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7710>`_
- Fixed incremental export to happen if start_version provided, even if last_export is null.
  `#7716 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7716>`_
- Fixed a file descriptor leak during repository version repair operations.
  `#7735 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7735>`_
- Fixed bug where exporter directory existed and was writable but not owned by worker process and thus
  not chmod-able.
  `#7829 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7829>`_
- Properly namespaced the `viewset_name` in `AccessPolicy` to avoid naming conflicts in plugins.
  `#7845 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7845>`_
- Update jquery version from 3.3.1 to 3.5.1 in API.html template. It is the version provided by djangorestframework~=3.12.2
  `#7850 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7850>`_
- Prevented a Redis failure scenario from causing the tasking system to back up due to "tasking system
  locks" not being released, even on worker restart.
  `#7907 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7907>`_
- Use subclassed plugin downloaders during the pulp repair.
  `#7909 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7909>`_


Improved Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added requirement to record a demo with PRs of substantial change.
  `#7703 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7703>`_
- Removed outdated reference stating Pulp did not have an SELinux policy.
  `#7793 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7793>`_


Removals
~~~~~~~~

- The local file system directory used for uploaded chunks is specified by the setting
  CHUNKED_UPLOAD_DIR. Users are encouraged to remove all uncommitted uploaded files before
  applying this change.

----------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Added ``UnsupportedDigestValidationError`` to ``pulpcore.plugins.exceptions``. Going
  forward, plugin authors can expect to find all unique exceptions under
  ``pulpcore.plugin.exceptions``.
  `#7908 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7908>`_


Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Plugins are encouraged to define a ``version`` attribute on their subclass of
  ``PulpPluginAppConfig``. If undefined while Pulp loads a warning is now shown to encourage plugin
  writers to implement this attribute, which will be required starting in pulpcore==3.10.
  `#6671 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/6671>`_
- Using the ViewSet's classname to identify its AccessPolicy has been deprecated and is slated for removal in 3.10.
  Instead the urlpattern is supposed to be used.

  Plugins with existing AccessPolicies should add a data migration to rename their AccessPolicies:

  ::
      access_policy = AccessPolicy.get(viewset_name="MyViewSet")
      access_policy.viewset_name = "objectclass/myplugin/myclass"
      access_policy.save()

  `#7845 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7845>`_
- The ``pulpcore.plugin.models.UnsupportedDigestValidationError`` is being deprecated and
  will be removed in 3.10.

  It can now be found at ``pulpcore.plugin.exceptions.UnsupportedDigestValidationError``
  instead; please change any code that imports it to access it from its new location.

Plugin API
----------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Adding `PulpTemporaryFile` for handling temporary files between the viewset and triggered tasks
  `#6749 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/6749>`_
- ``RepositorySyncURLSerializer`` will now check remote on the repository before it raises an
  exception if the remote param is not set.
  `#7015 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7015>`_
- Added a hook on ``Repository`` called ``artifacts_for_version()`` that plugins can override to
  modify the logic behind ``RepositoryVersion.artifacts``. For now, this is used when exporting
  artifacts.
  `#7021 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7021>`_
- Enabling plugin writers to have more control on `HttpDownloader` response codes 400+
  by subclassing `HttpDownloader` and overwriting `raise_for_status` method
  `#7117 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7117>`_
- `BaseModel` now inherits from `LifecycleModel` provided by `django-lifecycle` allowing any subclass
  to also use it instead of signals.
  `#7151 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7151>`_
- A new `pulpcore.plugin.models.AutoDeleteObjPermsMixin` object can be added to models to
  automatically delete all user and group permissions for an object just before the object is deleted.
  This provides an easy cleanup mechanism and can be added to models as a mixin. Note that your model
  must support `django-lifecycle` to use this mixin.
  `#7157 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7157>`_
- A new model `pulpcore.plugin.models.AccessPolicy` is available to store AccessPolicy statements in
  the database. The model's `statements` field stores the list of policy statements as a JSON field.
  The `name` field stores the name of the Viewset the `AccessPolicy` is protecting.

  Additionally, the `pulpcore.plugin.access_policy.AccessPolicyFromDB` is a drf-access-policy which
  viewsets can use to protect their viewsets with. See the :ref:`viewset_enforcement` for more
  information on this.
  `#7158 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7158>`_
- Adds the `TaskViewSet` and `TaskGroupViewSet` objects to the plugin api.

  `#7191 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7191>`_
- A new `pulpcore.plugin.models.AutoAddObjPermsMixin` object can be added to models to automatically
  add permissions for an object just after the object is created. This is controlled by data saved in
  the `permissions_assignment` attribute of the `pulpcore.plugin.models.AccessPolicy` allowing users
  to control what permissions are created. Note that your model must support `django-lifecycle` to use
  this mixin.
  `#7210 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7210>`_
- Added ability for plugin writers to set a ``content_mapping`` property on content resources to
  provide a custom mapping of content to repositories.
  `#7252 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7252>`_
- Automatically excluding ``pulp_id``, ``pulp_created``, and ``pulp_last_updated`` for
  ``QueryModelResources``.
  `#7277 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7277>`_
- Viewsets that subclass ``pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.NamedModelViewSet` can declare the
  ``queryset_filtering_required_permission`` class attribute naming the permission required to view
  an object. See the :ref:`queryset_scoping` documentation for more information.
  `#7300 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/7300>`_

==================
REST API
--------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Allow administrators to add a signing service
  `#5943 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/5943>`_
- Adds ``pulpcore.app.authentication.PulpDoNotCreateUsersRemoteUserBackend`` which can be used to

  `#5949 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/5949>`_

3.0.0 (2019-12-11)
==================

.. note::

    Task names, e.g. ``pulpcore.app.tasks.orphan.orphan_cleanup``, are subject to change in future
    releases 3.y releases. These are represented in the Task API as the "name" attribute. Please
    check future release notes to see when these names will be considered stable. Otherwise, the
    REST API pulpcore provides is considered semantically versioned.
