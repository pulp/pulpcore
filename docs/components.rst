Architecture
============

Pulp's architecture has three components to it: a REST API, a content serving application, and the
tasking system. Each component can be horizontally scaled for both high availability and/or
additional capacity for that part of the architecture.

REST API
--------

Pulp's REST API is a Django application that runs under any WSGI server. It serves the following
things:

* The REST API hosted at ``/pulp/api/v3/``
* The browse-able documentation at ``/pulp/api/v3/docs/``
* Any viewsets or views provided by plugins
* Static content used by Django, e.g. images used by the browse-able API. This is not Pulp content.

.. note::

   A simple, but limited way to run the REST API as a standalone service using the built-in Django
   runserver. The ``pulpcore-manager`` command is ``manage.py`` configured with the
   ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="pulpcore.app.settings"``. Run the simple webserver with::

      $ pulpcore-manager runserver 24817

The REST API can be deployed with any any WSGI webserver like a normal Django application. See the
`Django deployment docs <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/howto/deployment/wsgi/>`_ for more
information.

Content Serving Application
---------------------------

An aiohttp.server based application that serves content to clients. The content could be
:term:`Artifacts<Artifact>` already downloaded and saved in Pulp, or
:term:`on-demand content units<on-demand content>`. When serving
:term:`on-demand content units<on-demand content>` the downloading also happens from within this
component as well.

.. note::

   Pulp installs a script that lets you run the content serving app as a standalone service as
   follows:::

      $ pulp-content

The content serving application can be deployed like any aiohttp.server application. See the
`aiohttp Deployment docs <https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment.html>`_ for more
information.


Tasking System (current default)
--------------------------------

Pulp's tasking system has two components: a resource manager and workers, all of which are run using
`rq`_.

Worker
  Pulp workers perform most tasks "run" by the tasking system including long-running tasks like
  synchronize and short-running tasks like a Distribution update. Each worker handles one task at a
  time, and additional workers provide more concurrency. Workers auto-name and are auto-discovered,
  so they can be started and stopped without notifying Pulp.

Resource Manager
  A different type of Pulp worker that plays a coordinating role for the tasking system. You must
  run exactly one of these for Pulp to operate correctly. The ``resource-manager`` is identified by
  configuring using exactly the name ``resource-manager`` with the ``--resource-manager`` option.

  *N* ``resource-manager`` rq processes can be started with 1 being active and *N-1* being passive.
  The *N-1* will exit and should be configured to auto-relaunch with either systemd, supervisord, or
  k8s.

.. note::

   Pulp serializes tasks that are unsafe to run in parallel, e.g. a sync and publish operation on
   the same repo should not run in parallel. Generally tasks are serialized at the "resource" level, so
   if you start *N* workers you can process *N* repo sync/modify/publish operations concurrently.


Distributed Tasking System (tech-preview)
-----------------------------------------

Pulp provides an alternative implementation for the tasking system as a drop in replacement.

.. note::

   This distributed resource-manager free tasking system is still in tech-preview.

The major differences to the prior tasking system is, that tasks are not routed through a
``resource-manager``, and not queued into ``rq`` queues. So all necessary information about tasks
is stored in Pulp's Postgres database as a single source of truth. This version of the tasking
system consists of a single ``pulpcore-worker`` component consequently, and can be scaled by
increasing the number of worker processes. Each worker can handle one task at a time, and idle
workers will lookup waiting and ready tasks in a distributed manner. If no ready tasks were found
a worker enters a sleep state to be notified, once new tasks are available or resources are
released.

While this tasking system is designed with better scalability and high availability in mind, it
provides the same interfaces to the user via the REST API.

To switch to using this worker model, one needs to set ``USE_NEW_WORKER_STYLE=True`` in pulp
settings, and start the worker processes via ``pulpcore-worker`` instead of calling ``rq``.

.. note::

   Pulp serializes tasks that are unsafe to run in parallel, e.g. a sync and publish operation on
   the same repo should not run in parallel. Generally tasks are serialized at the "resource" level, so
   if you start *N* workers you can process *N* repo sync/modify/publish operations concurrently.

Static Content
--------------

When browsing the REST API or the browsable documentation with a web browser, for a good experience,
you'll need static content to be served.

In Development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If using the built-in Django webserver and your settings.yaml has ``DEBUG: True`` then static
content is automatically served for you.

In Production
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Collect all of the static content into place using the ``collectstatic`` command. The
``pulpcore-manager`` command is ``manage.py`` configured with the
``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="pulpcore.app.settings"``. Run ``collectstatic`` as follows::

    $ pulpcore-manager collectstatic
