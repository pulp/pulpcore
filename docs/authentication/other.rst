Pulp is a Django app and Django Rest Framework (DRF) application, so additional authentication can
be added as long as it's correctly configured for both Django and Django Rest Frameowork.

See the `Django docs on configuring custom authentication <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/
topics/auth/customizing/#customizing-authentication-in-django>`_ and the `Django Rest Framework docs
on configuring custom authentication <https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication
/#custom-authentication>`_.
