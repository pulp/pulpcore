Plugins
=======

Plugins add support for a type of content to Pulp. For example, the
`file_plugin <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_file>`_ adds support for Pulp to manage files.

Each plugin has its own documentation that contains setup, workflow, and conceptual information:

* `Pulp RPM plugin <https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_rpm/>`_.
* `Pulp File plugin <https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_file/>`_.

* `Pulp Python plugin <https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_python/>`_.
* `Pulp Gem plugin <https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_gem/>`_.
* `Pulp Chef Cookbook plugin <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_cookbook/blob/master/README.rst/>`_.
