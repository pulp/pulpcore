Plugins
=======

Plugins add support for a type of content to Pulp. For example, the
`file_plugin <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_file>`_ adds support for Pulp to manage files.

Each plugin has its own documentation that contains setup, workflow, and conceptual information:

* `Pulp RPM plugin <https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_rpm/>`_.
* `Pulp File plugin <https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_file/>`_.
* `Pulp Container plugin <https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_container/>`_.
* `Pulp Ansible plugin <https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_ansible/>`_.
* `Pulp Debian plugin <https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_deb/>`_.
* `Pulp Python plugin <https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_python/>`_.
* `Pulp Chef Cookbook plugin <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_cookbook/blob/master/README.rst/>`_.
* `Pulp Maven plugin <https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_maven/>`_.
* `Ansible GalaxyNG plugin <https://github.com/ansible/galaxy_ng/blob/master/README.md/>`_.
* `Pulp Certguard plugin <https://docs.pulpproject.org/certguard/>`_.
* `Pulp 2-to-3 Migration plugin <https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_2to3_migration/>`_.
