.. _configuration:

Configuration
=============

Pulp uses `dynaconf <https://dynaconf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for its settings which allows you
to configure Pulp in a few ways:


By Configuration File
---------------------

To configure Pulp by settings file, you must set the format and location of the config file by
specifying the ``PULP_SETTINGS`` environment variable. For example, if you wanted to use Python to
specify your configuration, and provide it at ``/etc/pulp/settings.py`` you could::

    export PULP_SETTINGS=/etc/pulp/settings.py


Or in a systemd file you could::

    Environment="PULP_SETTINGS=/etc/pulp/settings.py" as the Ansible Installer does.


Dynaconf supports `settings in multiple file formats <https://dynaconf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
guides/examples.html>`_

This file should have permissions of:

* mode: 640
* owner: root
* group: pulp (the group of the account that pulp runs under)
* SELinux context: system_u:object_r:etc_t:s0

If it is in its own directory like ``/etc/pulp``, the directory should have permissions of:

* mode: 750
* owner: root
* group: pulp (the group of the account that pulp runs under)
* SELinux context: unconfined_u:object_r:etc_t:s0

By Environment Variables
------------------------

Many users specify their Pulp settings entirely by Environment Variables. Each of the settings can
be configured using Dynaconf by prepending ``PULP_`` to the name of the setting and specifying that
as an Environment Variable. For example the ``SECRET_KEY`` can be specified by exporting the
``PULP_SECRET_KEY`` variable.


Settings
--------

Pulp uses three types of settings:

* :ref:`Django settings <django-settings>` Pulp is configuring
* :ref:`Pulp defined settings <pulp-settings>`
* :ref:`RQ settings <rq-settings>` Pulp is using


.. _django-settings:

Django Settings
---------------

Pulp is a Django project, so any Django `Django setting
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/settings/>`_ can also be set to configure your Pulp
deployment.

SECRET_KEY
^^^^^^^^^^

    In order to get a pulp server up and running a `Django SECRET_KEY
    <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/settings/#secret-key>`_ *must* be
    provided.

    The following code snippet can be used to generate a random SECRET_KEY.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   import random

   chars = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*(-_=+)'
   print(''.join(random.choice(chars) for i in range(50)))

DATABASES
^^^^^^^^^

   By default Pulp uses PostgreSQL on localhost. For all possible configurations please refer to
   `Django documentation on databases <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2
   .1/ref/settings/#databases>`_

DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   By default, Pulp uses the local filesystem to store files. The default option which
   uses the local filesystem is ``pulpcore.app.models.storage.FileSystem``.

   This can be configured though to alternatively use `Amazon S3 <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`_. To
   use S3, set ``DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE`` to ``storages.backends.s3boto3.S3Boto3Storage``. For more
   information about different Pulp storage options, see the :ref:`storage documentation <storage>`.

MEDIA_ROOT
^^^^^^^^^^

   The location where Pulp will store files. By default this is `/var/lib/pulp/`.

   If you're using S3, point this to the path in your bucket you want to save files. See the
   :ref:`storage documentation <storage>` for more info.

   It should have permissions of:

   * mode: 750
   * owner: pulp (the account that pulp runs under)
   * group: pulp (the group of the account that pulp runs under)
   * SELinux context: system_u:object_r:var_lib_t:s0

LOGGING
^^^^^^^

   By default Pulp logs at an INFO level to syslog. For all possible configurations please
   refer to `Django documenation on logging <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2
   .1/topics/logging/#configuring-logging>`_.

AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   By default, Pulp has two types of authentication enabled, and they fall back for each other:

   1. Basic Auth which is checked against an internal users database
   2. Webserver authentication that relies on the webserver to perform the authentication.

   To change the authentication types Pulp will use, modify the ``AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS``
   settings. See the `Django authentication documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/
   topics/auth/customizing/#authentication-backends>`_ for more information.

.. _rq-settings:

RQ Settings
-----------

The following RQ settings can be set in your Pulp config:

  * REDIS_URL
  * REDIS_HOST
  * REDIS_PORT
  * REDIS_DB
  * REDIS_PASSWORD
  * SENTINEL

These will be used by any worker loaded with the ``-c 'pulpcore.rqconfig'`` option.

Below are some common settings used for RQ configuration. See the `RQ settings documentation
<http://python-rq.org/docs/workers/#using-a-config-file>`_ for information on these settings.

REDIS_HOST
^^^^^^^^^^

   The hostname for Redis. By default Pulp will try to connect to Redis on localhost. `RQ
   documentation <https://python-rq.org/docs/workers/>`_ contains other Redis settings
   supported by RQ.

REDIS_PORT
^^^^^^^^^^

   The port for Redis. By default Pulp will try to connect to Redis on port 6380.

REDIS_PASSWORD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The password for Redis.


.. _pulp-settings:

Pulp Settings
-------------

Pulp defines the following settings itself:

WORKING_DIRECTORY
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The directory used by workers to stage files temporarily. This defaults to
   ``/var/lib/pulp/tmp/``.

   It should have permissions of:

   * mode: 755
   * owner: pulp (the account that pulp runs under)
   * group: pulp (the group of the account that pulp runs under)
   * SELinux context: unconfined_u:object_r:var_lib_t:s0

.. note::

    It is recommended that ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` and ``MEDIA_ROOT`` exist on the same storage
    volume for performance reasons. Files are commonly staged in the ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` and
    validated before being moved to their permanent home in ``MEDIA_ROOT``.


CONTENT_HOST
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   A string containing the protocol, fqdn, and port where the content app is deployed. This is used
   when Pulp needs to refer the client to the content serving app from within the REST API, such as
   the ``base_path`` attribute for a :term:`distribution`.

   This defaults to ``None`` which returns relative urls.


CONTENT_ORIGIN
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   A required string containing the protocol, fqdn, and port where the content app is reachable by
   users. This is used by ``pulpcore`` and various plugins when referring users to the content app.
   For example if the API should refer users to content at using http to pulp.example.com on port
   24816, (the content default port), you would set: ``https://pulp.example.com:24816``.


.. _content-path-prefix:

CONTENT_PATH_PREFIX
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   A string containing the path prefix for the content app. This is used by the REST API when
   forming URLs to refer clients to the content serving app, and by the content serving application
   to match incoming URLs.

   Defaults to ``'/pulp/content/'``.


.. _content-app-ttl:

CONTENT_APP_TTL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The number of seconds before a content app should be considered lost.

   Defaults to ``30`` seconds.


.. _remote-user-environ-name:

REMOTE_USER_ENVIRON_NAME
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The name of the WSGI environment variable to read for :ref:`webserver authentication
   <webserver-auth>`.

   .. warning::

      Configuring this has serious security implications. See the `Django warning at the end of this
      section in their docs <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/auth-remote-user/
      #configuration>`_ for more details.

   Defaults to ``'REMOTE_USER'``.


PROFILE_STAGES_API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   A debugging feature that collects profile data about the Stages API as it runs. See
   staging api profiling docs for more information.
