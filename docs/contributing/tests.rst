Testing Pulp
============

There are two types of tests in *pulp_core* and in the plugins:

1. **Unittests** are meant to test the interface of a specific unit utilizing a test database.
2. **Functional tests** are meant to test certain workflows utilizing a running instance of pulp.

A pull request that has failing unit or functional tests cannot be merged.

Unit Tests
----------

New code is encouraged to have basic unit tests that demonstrate that
units (function, method or class instance) are working correctly.

The unit tests for `pulpcore` are in `pulpcore/tests
<https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/tree/master/pulpcore/tests/unit>`_.

Functional Tests
----------------

Functional tests verify a specific feature.
In general functional tests tend to answer the question "As an user can I do this?"

Functional tests for Pulp are written using `Pulp Smash`_ . Pulp smash is a test
toolkit written to ease the testing of Pulp.

It is highly encouraged to accompany new features with functional
tests in `pulpcore/functional
<https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/tree/master/pulpcore/tests/functional>`_.

Only the tests for features related to `pulpcore` should live in this repository.

Functional tests for features related to a specific plugin should live in the
plugin repository itself. For example:

  * `File Plugin
    <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_file/tree/master/pulp_file/tests/functional>`_

  * `RPM Plugin
    <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/tree/master/pulp_rpm/tests/functional>`_

Prerequisites for running tests
-------------------------------

If you want to run the functional tests, you need a running Pulp instance that is allowed to be
mixed up by the tests (in other words, running the tests on a production instance is not
recommended). For example, using the development vm (see :ref:`DevSetup`),
this can be accomplished by `workon pulp; django-admin runserver 24817`.

Functional tests require a valid *pulp-smash*
`config <https://pulp-smash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html>`_ file.
This can be created with `pulp-smash settings create`.

Running tests
-------------

In case pulp is installed in a virtual environment, activate it first (`workon pulp`).

All tests of a plugin (or pulpcore itself) are run with `django-admin test <plugin_name>`.
This involves setting up (and tearing down) the test database, however the functional tests are
still performed against the configured pulp instance with its *production* database.

To only perform the unittests, you can skip the prerequisites and call
`django-admin test <plugin_name>.tests.unit`.

If you are only interested in functional tests, you can skip the creation of the test database by
using `pytest <path_to_plugin>/<plugin_name>/tests/functional`.

.. note::

    Make sure, the task runners are actually running. In doubt, run `prestart` or
    `systemctl restart pulpcore-worker@*`.

.. note::

    You can be more specific on which tests to run by calling something like
    `django-admin test pulp_file.tests.unit.test_models` or
    `py.test <path_to_plugin>/<plugin_name>/tests/functional/api/test_sync.py`.


Contributing to tests
---------------------

A new version of Pulp will only be released when all unit and functional tests are
passing.

Contributing test is a great way to ensure that your workflows never regress.
