# Contributing with docs

## Overview

The purpose of this quickstart is to help you to make docs-only contributing effortless, without requiring a full development setup.

## Workflow

### 1. Setup

Pulp uses a dedicated tool to aggregate documentation from its various repositories called [`pulp-docs`](#).

Once its installed, it'll look for local Pulp repo checkouts in the parent directory and, if not found,
it'll clone the last released repo from GitHub into a managed environment.

=== "pipx"

    ```bash
    pipx install pulp-docs
    ```

=== "pip"

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install pulp-docs
    ```

A more comprehensive guide on `pulp-docs` is documented  [here](#).

### 2. Makes a change

Make your changes using markdown and supported `mkdocs-material` features.

Our docs comply with the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/map/) for organizing content. Here is a brief summary:

|      | Tutorial | How-to Guide | Reference | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **purpose** | to provide a learning experience | to help achieve a particular goal | to describe the machinery | to illuminate a topic |
| **form** |   a lesson |    a series of steps |    dry description | discursive explanation |

Also, keep in mind that you are always writting primarily for one of the three types of `persona`:

- User: "I just want to create sync and publish repositorioes"
- Admin: "I need to get this instance configured and keep it running"
- Developer: "I need to add features, troubleshoot and fix bugs"
	
When you are done with your changes, you can preview it locally with:

```bash
pulp-docs serve
```

A more comprehensive guide on documentation writting can be found [here](#).

### 3. Update the changelog entry

Pulp uses [towncrier](#) to manage its changelog.

It requires that you have a related GitHub issue number, except for trivial changes (such as typo fixes).
In those cases the entry is no required at all. 

The changelog message should use past simple tense and describe the change being made (as opposed to the problem or user story). Creating an entry can look something like this:

=== "For User-Facing changes"

    ```bash
    # create entry file
    touch CHANGES/3245.doc

    # write a message using past simple tense
    echo "Added documentation for new pulpcore-manager command" > CHANGES/3245.doc
    ```

=== "For Plugin API changes"

    ```bash
    # create entry file
    touch CHANGES/plugin_api/3245.doc

    # write a message using past simple tense
    echo "Added documentation for new pulpcore-manager command" > CHANGES/3245.doc
    ```

A more comprehensive guide on using towncrier in the Pulp project is documented  [here](#).

### 4. Commit and Submit a PR

Commit messages in Pulp should contain a human readable explanation of what was fixed.
Here are general guidelines:

| extension    | description                                                          |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title | - Should be wrapped at about 50 chars
| Body | - Should be wrapped at wrapped at 72 characters
|  |    - May be broken up into paragraphs.
| Footer |  - Should Linked issue on the plugin Github Issue tracker. See the [Github Linking Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword).
| |- May have a [noissue] instead, if really required.

For more on what constitutes a good commit message, we recommend [Tim Popeâ€™s blog post on the subject](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html). Putting this all together, the following is an example of a good commit message:

```
Update install and quickstart documentation

The install docs and quickstart was leaving out an important step on
the worker configuration.

closes #1392
```
