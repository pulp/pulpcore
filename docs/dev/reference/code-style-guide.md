# Code Style Guide

## Python Version

All Pulp 3+ code will use Python 3.8+.
It is not necessary to maintain backwards compatibility with Python 2.Y.

## PEP-8

All code should be compliant with [PEP-8] where reasonable.

It is recommended that contributors check for compliance by running [flake8].
We include `flake8.cfg` files in our git repositories for convenience.

## Black

All python code (except for the usually generated files in the migration folder) must be formatted according to the ruleset defined by [black].
As [black] is able to automatically reformat python code, contributors are supposed to run `black .` in the repositories `pulpcore` directory.
For various IDEs / editors, there is also an [integration] for [black].

### Modifications:

line length: We limit to 100 characters, rather than 79.

## Documentation

Documentation is written in MarkDown using mkdocs with the material theme and some extensions.
You can find a comprehensive list of examples in our [markdown cheat sheet].
We encourage to break lines at semantic boundaries to ease editing and reviewing small docs changes.
This is also termed "one sentence per line" rule, but do not take that too literally.

Rules of thumb:

* Use your best judgement.
* Avoid complicated sentence structure.
* Write technical prose, not lyrical.

### In-code Documentation

In-code documentation should follow the general documentation guidelines listed above.

Most classes and functions should have a docstring that follows the conventions described in [Google's Python Style Guide].

# Exceptions and Clarifications

1. Modules should not include license information.
2. The type of each Args value should be included after the variable name in parentheses.
   The type of each Returns value should be the first item on the line.
3. Following the type of Args and Returns values, there will be a colon and a single space followed by the description.
   Additional spaces should not be used to align types and descriptions.
4. Fields and Relations sections will be used when documenting fields on Django models.
   The Fields section will be used for non-related fields on Model classes.
   The Relations section will be used for related fields on Model classes.

# Auto-Documentation

Docstrings will be used for auto-documentation and must be parsable by the
[Napoleon plugin for Sphinx].

# Example Docstring

```python
def example_function():
    """
    The first section is a summary, which should be restricted to a single line.

    More detailed information follows the summary after a blank line.
    This section can be as many lines as necessary.

    Args:
        arg1 (str): The argument is visible, and its type is clearly indicated.
        much_longer_argument (str): Types and descriptions are not aligned.

    Returns:
        bool: The return value and type is very clearly visible.

    """
```

# Encoding

Python 3 assumes that files are encoded with UTF-8, so it is not necessary to declare this in the file.
