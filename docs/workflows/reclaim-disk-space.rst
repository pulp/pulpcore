Reclaim disk space for a list of repositories
---------------------------------------------

.. note::

    Pulp's reclaim disk space feature is in tech-preview and may change in backwards incompatible
    ways in future releases.


Pulp provides the ability to reclaim disk space for:

  * content that one no longer needs to serve but would like to keep in the repo for historical
    reasons.
  * repos that were synced with the on_demand download policy and one would want to clear out
    downloaded files for those repos. Usually, a repository that was synced with the on_demand
    download policy will store artifacts locally after they have been requested by the client, but
    there really isn't a way to have pulp delete the locally stored files and free disk space if
    these packages are unlikely to be used again.

To start a reclaim task send a POST request to `/pulp/api/v3/repositories/reclaim_space/`.

.. code-block::

    $ RECLAIM_TASK=$(http POST :24817/pulp/api/v3/repositories/reclaim_space/ repo_hrefs:=[\"/pulp/api/v3/repositories/rpm/rpm/b3a6674d-181c-4e72-9412-7cbc747480ad/\"] | qq -r '.task')
    $ http --body :24817$RECLAIM_TASK

     }

As a result of this request, disk space will be freed-up for artifacts that are exclusive to the
list of provided repos. The content of the repository versions will not change and no repository
versions will be created or removed.

An optional ``repo_versions_keeplist`` parameter can be specified, that will contain list of repo
version hrefs which will be excluded from the artifact removal.

The task will remove artifacts only from content that was synced from a remote source. It will not
touch the content that was uploaded directly into Pulp.

.. note::

   The task will clean up artifacts regardless of the download policy. The content app will be able
   to stream artifact if it is locally available, otherwise it will attempt to redownload it from
   the known upstream urls. In case upstream stopped serving the corresponding file, Pulp won't be
   able to download and serve it.
