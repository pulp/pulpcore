# Releasing (For Internal Use)

This document outlines the steps to perform a release.

### Determine if a Release is Required
- Make sure to have GitPython python package installed
- Run the release checker script:
  ```
  python3 .ci/scripts/check_release.py
  ```

### Release a New Y-version (e.g., 3.23.0)
- If a new minor version (Y) is needed, trigger a [Create New Release Branch](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/actions/workflows/create-branch.yml) job from the main branch via the GitHub Actions.
- Look for the "Bump minor version" pull request and merge it.
- Trigger a [Release Pipeline](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/actions/workflows/release.yml) job by specifying the new release branch (X.**Y**) via the GitHub Actions.

### Release a New Z-version (Patch Release) (e.g., 3.23.1, 3.22.12)
- Trigger a [Release Pipeline](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/actions/workflows/release.yml) job by specifying the release branch (X.Y) via the GitHub Actions.

## Final Steps
- Ensure the new version appears on PyPI (it should appear after [Publish Release](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/actions/workflows/publish.yml) workflow succeeds).
- Verify that the changelog has been updated by looking for the "Update Changelog" pull request (A new PR should be available on the next day).
- [optional] Post a brief announcement about the new release on the [Pulp Discourse](https://discourse.pulpproject.org/).
