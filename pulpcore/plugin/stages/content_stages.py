    This stage resolves the futures in :class:`~pulpcore.plugin.stages.DeclarativeContent`.

    Futures results are set to the found/created :class:`~pulpcore.plugin.models.Content`.

    This is useful when data downloaded from the plugin API needs to be parsed by FirstStage to
    create additional :class:`~pulpcore.plugin.stages.DeclarativeContent` objects to be send down
    the pipeline. Consider an example where content type `Foo` references additional instances of a
    different content type `Bar`. Consider this code in FirstStage::

        # Create d_content and d_artifact for a `foo_a`
        foo_a = DeclarativeContent(...)
        # Send it in the pipeline
        await self.put(foo_a)

        ...

        foo_a_content = await foo_a.resolution()  # awaits until the foo_a reaches this stage

    This creates a "looping" pattern, of sorts, where downloaded content at the end of the pipeline
    can introduce new additional to-be-downloaded content at the beginning of the pipeline.
    On the other hand, it can impose a substantial performance decrement of batching content in the
    earlier stages.
    If you want to drop a declarative content prematurely from the pipeline, use the function
    `resolve()` to unblock the coroutines awaiting the attached future and do not hand the content
    to the next stage.
    As a rule of thumb, sending more items into the pipeline first and awaiting their resolution
    later is better.
