class HttpDownloader(BaseDownloader):
    """
    An HTTP/HTTPS Downloader built on `aiohttp`.

    This downloader downloads data from one `url` and is not reused.

    The downloader optionally takes a session argument, which is an `aiohttp.ClientSession`. This
    allows many downloaders to share one `aiohttp.ClientSession` which provides a connection pool,
    connection reuse, and keep-alives across multiple downloaders. When creating many downloaders,
    have one session shared by all of your `HttpDownloader` objects.

    A session is optional; if omitted, one session will be created, used for this downloader, and
    then closed when the download is complete. A session that is passed in will not be closed when
    the download is complete.

    If a session is not provided, the one created by HttpDownloader uses non-default timing values.
    Specifically, the "total" timeout is set to None and the "sock_connect" and "sock_read" are both
    5 minutes. For more info on these settings, see the aiohttp docs:
    http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/client_quickstart.html#timeouts Behaviorally, it should
    allow for an active download to be arbitrarily long, while still detecting dead or closed
    sessions even when TCPKeepAlive is disabled.

    If a session is not provided, the one created will force TCP connection closure after each
    request. This is done for compatibility reasons due to various issues related to session
    continuation implementation in various servers.

    `aiohttp.ClientSession` objects allows you to configure options that will apply to all
    downloaders using that session such as auth, timeouts, headers, etc. For more info on these
    options see the `aiohttp.ClientSession` docs for more information:
    http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/client_reference.html#aiohttp.ClientSession

    The `aiohttp.ClientSession` can additionally be configured for SSL configuration by passing in a
    `aiohttp.TCPConnector`. For information on configuring either server or client certificate based
    identity verification, see the aiohttp documentation:
    http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/client.html#ssl-control-for-tcp-sockets

    For more information on `aiohttp.BasicAuth` objects, see their docs:
    http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/client_reference.html#aiohttp.BasicAuth

    Synchronous Download::

        downloader = HttpDownloader('http://example.com/')
        result = downloader.fetch()

    Parallel Download::

        download_coroutines = [
            HttpDownloader('http://example.com/').run(),
            HttpDownloader('http://pulpproject.org/').run(),
        ]

        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        done, not_done = loop.run_until_complete(asyncio.wait(download_coroutines))

        for task in done:

                pass  # fatal exceptions are raised by result()

    The HTTPDownloaders contain automatic retry logic if the server responds with HTTP 429 response.
    The coroutine will automatically retry 10 times with exponential backoff before allowing a
    final exception to be raised.

    Attributes:
        session (aiohttp.ClientSession): The session to be used by the downloader.
        auth (aiohttp.BasicAuth): An object that represents HTTP Basic Authorization or None
        proxy (str): An optional proxy URL or None

            as its argument. The callback will be called when the response headers are
            available. The dictionary passed has the header names as the keys and header values
            as its values. e.g. `{'Transfer-Encoding': 'chunked'}`. This can also be None.
